== Checkbook

This chapter will give you all the specific information you need to
manage your checkbook with GnuCash. Managing your checkbook register is the
first step of tracking your finances, and GnuCash makes it much easier to
manage than the traditional paper register does.

For one thing, as discussed in <<chapter_txns>>,
data entry of common
transactions is practically done for you in GnuCash, because of its
auto-completion feature. GnuCash keeps a running balance of each account,
and it makes reconciling these accounts easy. And the double-entry method
helps you account for your spending by requiring a transfer account for
withdrawals, so you can easily find out how much money you spend in
different areas.

Once you are comfortable with using GnuCash for your checking and
other bank accounts, you may wish to continue on with tracking other
financial accounts. Chapters 6 through 9 examine methods to manage your
other accounts.

[[cbook-accounts1]]

=== Setting up Accounts

The first step in managing your checkbook is to set up the necessary
accounts. You can either use the default GnuCash accounts or set up your
own. For more detail on how to set up a new account, refer to
<<accts-examples-toplevel2>>.
For instructions on importing your accounts from another program, refer to the
GnuCash manual.

Let&rsquo;s start with the bank accounts you&rsquo;ll need. You need one GnuCash
bank type account for each physical bank account you wish to track. If you
are setting up your own accounts or using the default GnuCash accounts,
make sure that you have an opening balance transaction for each bank
account you own. The easiest way to get this number is to use the balance
from your last bank statement as your opening balance. You can enter this
in the account information window automatically as part of the
New Account Hierarchy Setup assistant, or you can enter a
manual transaction directly in the account. To enter the transaction
manually, enter a transfer from an Opening Balances
account (type equity) to the bank account.

The typical bank accounts you might track include:



** Checking - any institutional account that provides check-writing
privileges.

** Savings - an interest-bearing institutional account usually used
to hold money for a longer term than checking accounts.


Common transactions that affect these bank accounts are payments and
deposits. __Payments__ are transfers of money out of the
bank account, usually to an expense account. __Deposits__
are transfers of money into the bank account, usually from an income
account. You will need to set up income and expense accounts to track
where that money comes from and where it goes. Remember that a balanced
transaction requires a transfer of an equal sum of money from at least one
account to at least one other account. So if you deposit money in your
checking account, you must also enter the account that money comes from.
If you pay a bill from your checking account, you must also enter the
account where that money goes.

[[cbook-deposits1]]

=== Entering Deposits

Most deposit transactions are entered as a transfer from an income
account to a bank account. Income may come from many sources, and it&rsquo;s a
good idea to set up a separate income type account for each different
source. For example, your income may come mainly from your paychecks, but
you may also receive interest on your savings. In this case, you should
have one income account for salary and another income account for interest
income.


[TIP]
====
Be sure to check the Tax-Related box and assign an appropriate tax
category in the Income Tax Information Dialog (menu:Edit[Tax
      Report Options])
when you set up taxable income accounts. Some types of income,
such as gift income, may not be considered taxable, so check the
appropriate tax rules to determine what is taxable. For ways to track
capital gains income, refer to <<chapter_capgain>>.

====

Before you start entering paycheck deposits, decide how much detail
you want to track. The basic level of detail is to enter your net pay,
just like you would in your paper register. This is easiest, but you can
get even more information out of GnuCash if you enter your gross pay with
deductions. It takes a bit more effort to enter the deductions, but
entering your tax withholding information throughout the year allows you
to run useful tax status reports in GnuCash at any time. These reports can
help you determine whether you are withholding enough tax, and they can
help you estimate your tax bill ahead of time. If you are unsure about the
level of detail, start by entering net pay. You can always go back and
edit your transactions later if you decide you want more detail.

[[cbook-withdrawals1]]

=== Entering Withdrawals

When you withdraw money from your bank account, for whatever reason,
you are transferring money from your bank account to some other location.
In GnuCash, this other location is tracked as an account. The more
detailed accounts you create and use for your spending, the more
information you will get about where your money goes.

Withdrawals take many forms. ATM withdrawals are one of the most
common transactions. Writing checks is one way to withdraw money to pay
bills, to buy purchases, or to give to charity. Depending on your bank,
you might also have service charges, where the bank withdraws the money
from your account. Transfers of money out to another account are also
withdrawals. We will take a look at each of these types of withdrawals and
how to record them in GnuCash.

[[cbook-atm2]]

==== ATM/Cash Withdrawals

Cash withdrawals are handled as a transfer from a bank account to
a cash account. GnuCash provides special __Cash__ type
accounts for tracking your cash purchases, so you should set up a cash
account to record your ATM and other cash withdrawals.

Cash accounts can be used for different levels of detail. On a
basic level of detail, you simply transfer money to it from your
checking account. That tells you how much money you took out of checking
on a given day, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you where that cash was spent. With
a little more effort, you can use the cash account to record your cash
purchases as well, so that you can see where that cash went. You record
these purchases as a transfer from the cash account to expense
accounts.

Some people record every cash purchase, but this takes a lot of
work. An easier way is to record the purchases for which you have
receipts, but then adjust the balance of the account to match what is in
your wallet.

It&rsquo;s a good idea to at least set up a cash account for your
withdrawals. Then if you decide to track where your cash goes, you can
enter transactions for the money you spend. You determine what level of
detail you want to use.

[[cbook-reconacct1]]

=== Reconciling Your Accounts

GnuCash makes reconciliation of your bank account with your monthly
bank statement much easier. <<txns-reconcile1>>
gives instructions on how to
reconcile your transactions with the monthly bank statement. This is the
main reconciliation task that should be done every month.

But what about all those other accounts you created? Should those be
reconciled too? If you receive a statement for the account, then you
should consider reconciling that account. Examples include the checking
account statement, the savings account statement, and the credit card
statement. Credit card statements and credit card transactions are covered
in the <<chapter_cc>>, so if you are interested in
tracking your credit cards in GnuCash, take a look at the instructions
provided there.

Income and expense accounts are usually not reconciled, because
there is no statement to check them against. You also don&rsquo;t need to
reconcile cash accounts, for the same reason. With a cash account, though,
you might want to adjust the balance every once in a while, so that your
actual cash on hand matches the balance in your cash account. Adjusting
balances is covered in the next section.

[[cbook-together1]]

=== Putting It All Together

In <<chapter_txns>>, you entered some transactions
in your checking account. In this chapter, we will add more transactions and
then reconcile them.

[[cbook-puttoget-open2]]

==== Opening Balances

So, let&rsquo;s get started by opening the gcashdata file you saved in the
last chapter (__$$gcashdata_4$$__). Your chart of accounts
should look like this:

[[cbook-gcashdata4]]
.The Chart of Accounts
image::figures/cbook_gcashdata4.png["This image shows the Chart of Accounts.",width=]

[[cbook-puttoget-transactions]]

==== Add some transactions


. Now open the __Checking__ account from the main window. In the last
chapter, you entered some paycheck transactions as deposits into
Checking. Now we will enter another kind of deposit - a transfer of
money from Savings into Checking. On a blank line, enter a transaction
to transfer $500 from __Savings__ to __Checking__ (In this case, the last
transaction date was March 28, but this transfer transaction took
place on the March 24). Your Transfer account will be __Savings__, since
you are in the __Checking__ account. Your __Checking__ account should now look
like this:
+
[[cbook-transferin]]
.The Checking Account Register
image::figures/cbook_transferin.png["This image shows the Checking Account Register.",width=]


. Now let&rsquo;s write some checks on this account. First, write a
check to HomeTown Grocery for $75 (5th of March). Your transfer account
is __Groceries__, since all of this money is going to buy groceries. Next,
write a check to ABC Hardware for $100 (6 of March), and split this
amount between two expenses: __Household__ $50 and __Tools__ $50. You will
need to create an __Expense__ type account for each of these, then enter
splits for them. Your checking account should now look like
this;
+
[[cbook-checkexamp]]
.The Checking Account Register
image::figures/cbook_checkexamp.png["This image shows the Checking Account Register after registering some more checks.",width=]


. Suppose you now need to withdraw some money. You don&rsquo;t have a
cash account set up in your chart of accounts, so you will need to
create one. Create the account as Cash as a
top-level account of type Asset. From your
__Checking__ account register, enter an ATM type withdrawal to transfer
$100 from __Checking__ to __Cash__ on the 25 of March.
+
[[cbook-atm]]
.The Checking Account Register
image::figures/cbook_atm.png["This image shows the Checking Account Register with an ATM withdrawal.",width=]

[[cbook-puttoget-reconcile]]

==== Opening Balances

Now we are ready to reconcile this __Checking__ account, using this
sample bank statement:

[[cbook-bankstmt]]
.A sample Bank Statement
image::figures/cbook_bankstmt.png["This image shows a sample Bank Statement.",width=]


. Select menu:Actions[Reconcile] from the menu, and fill
in the Closing balance as $1451.79. Click OK to begin reconciling the
account. Check off the entries as they appear on the sample statement.
When you have checked off all your entries, the reconcile window
should look like this:

+
[[cbook-reconexamp]]
.The reconcile window
image::figures/cbook_reconexamp.png["This image shows the reconcile window with a $5 difference.",width=]
+
Notice that your reconciled balance differs from your ending
balance by $5.00. If you look at the sample bank statement, you will
see there is a $5.00 service charge that has not been added to your
__Checking__ account.



. So click on the __Checking__ register and add the $5.00 service
charge to your __Checking__ account. On a blank line of the __Checking__
register, enter a transaction to transfer $5.00 from __Checking__ to a
__Service Charges__ account. (You will need to create the __Service Charges__
account as type Expense.) Use the transaction date printed on the
sample statement as the date you enter for this transaction. Your
__Checking__ account should now look like this:
+
[[cbook-servch]]
.The Checking Account Register
image::figures/cbook_servch.png["This image shows the Checking Account Register with service charge added.",width=]


. Click back on the Reconcile window, and you should see the
service charge now under Funds Out. Click on it to mark it as
reconciled, and note that the difference amount below now becomes
0.00. Click the Finish button on the __Toolbar__ to complete the
reconciliation. The Reconcile R column in your __Checking__ register
should now show y for each transaction you just
reconciled. Also observe the bottom status row that now indicates
Reconciled: USD 1451.79

[[cbook-puttoget-save]]

==== Save file

Go back to the main window and save your file with the new
__$$gcashdata_5$$__ name. Your chart of accounts is
steadily growing, and it should now look like this:

[[cbook-chartaccts5]]
.The Chart of Accounts
image::figures/cbook_chartaccts5.png["This image shows the Chart of Accounts.",width=]

[[cbook-puttoget-reports]]

==== Reports

As we did in the previous chapter, let&rsquo;s have a look at a
Cash Flow, and a Transaction Report.



. First let&rsquo;s have a look at the Cash Flow report
for the month of March.
+
Select the cash flow report from menu:Reports[Income &amp; Expense &gt; Cash Flow].

+
[[cbook-puttoget2-Cash]]
.Cash Flow report for the month of March
image::figures/cbook_CashFlow.png["This image shows the Cash Flow report after .",width=]


. Now let&rsquo;s have a look at corresponding transaction report for the various
Asset accounts.

+
Select the transaction report from menu:Reports[Transaction Report].

+
[[cbook-puttoget2-TransactionRptChecking]]
.Transaction Report for the Assets accounts during March
image::figures/cbook_TransactionRptAssets.png["This image shows the Transaction Report for the Assets accounts during March.",width=]


. Now let&rsquo;s change the transaction report to only show the various
__Expenses__ account.

.Transaction Report for the Expenses accounts during March
image::figures/cbook_TransactionRptExpenses.png["This image shows the Transaction Report for the various Expense accounts during March.",width=]

Notice that you have not yet used one of the accounts listed in your
chart, the Credit Card account. Now that you know how
to keep track of your bank and cash accounts in GnuCash, you may want to
start tracking your credit cards as well. GnuCash provides a special type
of account for credit cards, and this is discussed in the next
chapter.
