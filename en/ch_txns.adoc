== Transactions

This chapter will give you the basic information you need to
understand and use transactions in GnuCash. Whereas accounts are the
framework and structure of a chart of accounts, transactions are the data
which fills each account.

[[txns-concepts1]]

=== Basic Concepts

A __transaction__ in a double entry accounting
system such as GnuCash is an exchange between at least 2 accounts. Thus, a
single transaction must always consist of at least two parts, a __from__ and
a __to__ account. The __from__ account is transferring value to the __to__ account.
Accountants call these parts of a transaction __Ledger Entries__. In GnuCash, they are called
__Splits__.

A split identifies the account to which it refers, the
amount of money specifically moved to or from that account, and
can contain a few other specific pieces of information if needed.
GnuCash supports multiple splits in a
single transaction, and the splits can move money into or out of
the involved accounts arbitrarily.

For example, you receive a paycheck and deposit it into your savings
account at the bank. The __transaction__ that occurs is
that your bank savings account (an asset) received money from your income
account. Two accounts are affected, and in this case there is a net
increase in your equity.

Working with transactions in GnuCash is performed using what is
known as the __account register__. Every account you
create has an account register. It will appear familiar to you as it looks
very similar to the log used to track checkbooks.

The account register is explained in the upcoming section,
<<txns-register-oview>>.

[[txns-register-oview]]

=== The Account Register

The __account register__ is the GnuCash window, which allows you to view or edit preexisting transactions, or add new transactions for a particular account. To open an account register from the Account Tree, double-click the account name, right click the account name and select Open Account from the menu, or use the Open button on the toolbar. GnuCash will display the account register window.

[[txns-registers-features2]]

==== Features of the Account Register

The __Titlebar__ of the account register displays the account name. Below the __Titlebar__, the __Menubar__ displays the menu items available within the account register, and the __Toolbar__ contains handy buttons that help you work with the account register.

At the bottom left of the register window, GnuCash displays helpful messages as you move about the register. To the right, you can see the current account balance and the total of cleared splits.

[[txns-regstyle1]]

==== Choosing a Register Style

GnuCash offers several options for viewing your registers. The
default style is Basic Ledger mode, which displays
only the summary of splits affecting the current account. This is the
style that most closely resembles other popular personal financial
packages. You can choose a different register style from the menu:View[] menu. There are two other view modes:



** menu:View[Auto-Split Ledger]
style expands the current transaction automatically. As you highlight a
new transaction in the register, the transaction automatically expands to
show all splits.

** menu:View[Transaction
        Journal] style shows all splits for all transactions in the register, which is more like an accounting journal.


All styles permit you to view your data in either single-line or
double-line format. Select menu:View[Double Line], and you will see your transaction
line expand to two register lines. Double-line mode will also display the transaction-level Notes field.

Below are screenshots that demonstrate how the Basic Ledger and Transaction Journal views differ.


For this example, let&rsquo;s assume that you have purchased 3 pair of Jeans for $1,000, and have recorded the purchase as a split transaction with each pair entered on a separate split.

The below screenshots illustrate the different view modes.

First let&rsquo;s view the Jeans transaction from your checking account:

[[txns-registersplit4]]
.3 Jeans purchases
image::figures/txns_registersplit4.png["This image shows one split transaction with 3 Jeans purchases",width=]

Now, let's open the __Expenses:Clothes__ account, and look at it in Basic view.

[[txns-registersplit5]]
.A jump to the __Expenses:Clothes__ account
image::figures/txns_registersplit5.png["This image shows Expenses:Clothes account in Basic Ledger mode.",width=]

Three entries appear here, but there was only the single split entry in the checking account. Further examination shows that each row has a different amount, $200, $300, and $500. This demonstrates that each row in this view reflects a single split from the original transaction.

Changing to Transaction Journal mode will display only the original split transaction.

[[txns-registersplit6]]
.A jump to the __Expenses:Clothes__ account
image::figures/txns_registersplit6.png["This image shows Expenses:Clothes account in Transaction Journal mode.",width=]

[[txns-shortcuts1]]

==== Using Entry Shortcuts

GnuCash provides several time-saving shortcuts for entering your
data. When you type the first few characters of a description that you
have used before, the QuickFill feature automatically fills in the rest of
the transaction as you last entered it. When you type in the first
characters of an account name in either the Transfer
field of the transaction line or the Account field of
the split line, QuickFill will automatically complete the name from your
account list. It also helps you with entering sub-accounts in these
fields: simply type the first characters of the parent account name
followed by a : (colon) and the first characters of the sub-account name. For
example, to enter __Assets:Checking__, you might type
**`A:C`** and let GnuCash fill in the rest.


[WARNING]
====
Because : is the account separator symbol,
you can not use it in your account names.

====


[TIP]
====
If you really need the colon in your account names, you can select another symbol by
menu:Edit[Preferences &gt; Accounts &gt; Character].

====

Register keyboard shortcuts also save you time, and GnuCash provides
several of them. In the date field, you can type:



** + or = to increment the date
and - or _ to decrement the
date

** ] or } to increment the month
and [ or { to decrement the
month

** M or m to enter the first date
of the month

** H or h to enter the last date
of the month

** Y or y to enter the first date
of the year

** R or r to enter the last date
of the year

** T or t to enter today&rsquo;s
date



[TIP]
====
These date shortcuts not only work in the account register but everywhere
you can enter a date.

====


[TIP]
====
Specifically for dates there's another way you can save time: you can enter
partial dates. For example if you only enter one number, GnuCash
will interpret it as the day in the current month of the current year. If you only enter
a day and month, GnuCash will automatically append the year. The
default this to take such a date in a sliding window starting 11 months before the current
month. This means that if you enter 1/5 (January 5th) as date while the current date is
in December 2015, the date will be completed as 1/5/16. This default can be changed via
menu:Edit[Preferences &gt; Date/Time &gt; Date Completion]. You can change it to either always
evaluate a date in the current calendar year or change the start of the sliding window.

====

In the Num field of the transaction line, you
can type + to increment the transaction number from the
last one you typed in. Typing - will decrement the
number. This will also work in the Action field of
the split line, if you choose to enter split numbers there. The
Action field also supports QuickFill - if you type
the first characters of a common action (such as
Deposit), GnuCash will fill in the rest.

The Transfer field supports QuickFill
of account names.  You can start typing an account name and
GnuCash will fill in the remaining part of the name.  Typing the
separator character at any time will complete the current level of
the account name, leaving the cursor positioned to start the next
level of account name.  For example, typing A:C the
standard set of account names will complete to the
__Assets:Checking__ account.  You can also type the
Menu or CtrlDown keys in this
field to pop up a list of all account names.

In any of the amount fields, you can use a built-in calculator.
Simply type in the first value, followed by +,
-, *, or /, then type
in the second value. GnuCash will perform the calculation and return the
resulting value to the amount field when you press the
Tab key.

All of the menu items have access keys defined, and these are marked
by underlined characters in the menu names. Press Alt +
[underlined character] to bring up the menu, then select an item by typing
its underlined character. For example, typing AltA brings up the Actions menu, then typing
P will split the transaction. A few of the menu items
also have shortcut keys that immediately invoke the command (typically
using the Ctrl key).  These shortcuts are listed next
to the item.

To move around the register, use these keys to save time:



** Tab to move to the next field, ShiftTab to move to the previous field

** Home to move to the beginning of the field,
End to move to the end of the field

** Enter or ↓ to move to the next
transaction, ↑ to move to the previous
transaction

** Page Up to move up one screen, Page
                Down to move down one screen

** ShiftPage Up to go to the first transaction, ShiftPage Down to go to the last transaction


In the Reconcile window you can use these
keyboard shortcuts:



** Tab moves to the next box and
ShiftTab
moves to the previous
box

** Space bar toggles the status between reconciled and not
reconciled

** ↑ and ↓ navigate through the
entries within the current box


[[txns-registers-txntypes]]

=== Simple vs. Split Transactions

Every transaction in GnuCash has at least two splits, but a transaction can have more than two splits. A transaction with only two splits is called a __simple transaction__, since it only involves the current account and a single remote account. A transaction with three or more accounts is called a __split transaction__.

When the register is in Basic view, you will see a summary of the splits affecting the current account. For a simple transaction, the Transfer column will display the other account from which money is __transferred__. For a split transaction, the Transfer column will display -- Split Transaction --. You can see the individual splits of each
transaction by clicking the Split button in the
__Toolbar__ while selecting the appropriate transaction.

For split transactions, the first line of the transaction is the
__transaction line__. It contains a
Date, optional Num (such as a
check number), transaction Description, total
amount affecting the current account (Tot Deposit
here), and updated account Balance after the
current transaction. Note that in the expanded view, the
Transfer column heading disappears, and there is no
account name listed in that field. This line shows you only a summary of
the transaction&rsquo;s effect on the current account. For more detailed
information, you need to look at the individual splits that make up the
transaction.


[NOTE]
====
Note: An account register displays a transaction when that
transaction has a split assigned to the account. If a given transaction
has more than one split assigned to the account, then in Basic and
Auto-Split views, that transaction will appear in the register one
time for each split assigned to that account. In Transaction Journal
view, such a transaction will only appear once in the register.

====

The partial lines below the transaction line are the
__split lines__, and they are separated by gray lines.
As you highlight one of the split lines, the column headings change to
show the split-related fields:

[[txns-registersplit2]]
.How split headings change
image::figures/txns_registersplit2.png["This image shows how split headings change.",width=]

Each split contains an optional Action, or
type of split, which you can either type in or choose from a pull-down
list. The split also contains an optional Memo
which describes the split. Each split affects an
Account, which can be selected from a pull-down
list of your accounts. The R field indicates
whether the split has been reconciled. The last two columns show the
amount of the split and whether money is coming into or going out of the
account.

As we discussed in <<basics-accounting1>>, total
debits (left-column entries) must equal total credits (right-column
entries) for each transaction. In the example shown above, the total
debits equal the total credits, so this transaction is balanced. If you
notice, the transaction line contains the same debit amount as the
Checking split line. Why is this shown twice?
Because the transaction line is merely a __summary__ of
the transaction&rsquo;s effect on the current account. The same transaction in
a different account will have a different transaction line, one that
shows the effect on that particular account. You can see this by
highlighting another split line and clicking the
Jump button on the __Toolbar__.

In this example, if you jump to the
__Income:Salary__ account, GnuCash brings up the same
transaction in the __Income:Salary__ - Register:

[[txns-registersplit3]]
.A jump to the __Income:Salary__ account
image::figures/txns_registersplit3.png["This image shows a jump to the Income:Salary account.",width=]

Note that the transaction line total now summarizes the effect on
the __Income:Salary__ account instead of the
__Checking Account__, because you are looking at the
__Income:Salary__ account register. The splits are
exactly the same, but the transaction line now reflects the credit to
the __Income:Salary__ account.

[[txns-registers-twoaccount2]]

==== Simple Transaction Example

Starting with the chart of accounts we created in the
previous chapter __$$gcashdata_3$$__, double click on the
Checking asset account. Let&rsquo;s add a simple
transaction to the checking account. When you first create your accounts
in GnuCash, it is common to start them off with an initial
balance.

In the first transaction row, enter a date (eg: March, 1, 2006), a
description (eg: "Opening Balance"), click on the Transfer pop-up menu
and select __Equity:Opening Balances__, add a deposit
value of $1000, and press the Enter key. The account register should now
appear similar to this figure:

[[txns-register-2account]]
.The Checking Account - Register
image::figures/txns_register_2account.png["This image shows Assets:Checking - Register after inserting a starting value transaction.",width=]

Setting the starting balances of an account is an example of a
simple two account transaction. In this case, affecting the
__Assets:Checking__ and the __Equity:Opening Balances__
accounts.

As another example of a simple 2 account transaction, add another
transaction to describe the purchase of $45.21 worth of groceries. From
within the __Assets:Checking__ account, you would set
Transfer to
__Expenses:Groceries__. The account register should now
appear:

[[txns-register-2account2]]
.The Checking Account - Register
image::figures/txns_register_2account2.png["This image shows Assets:Checking - Register after adding a transaction for groceries.",width=]

[[txns-registers-multiaccount2]]

==== Split Transaction Example

The need for 3 or more splits in a transaction occurs when you need
to split either the "from" or the "to" account in a transaction into
multiple accounts. The classic example of this is when you receive a
paycheck. Your take home pay from a paycheck will typically be less than
your net pay, with the difference being due to taxes, retirement account
payments, and/or other items. Thus, the single transaction of you
receiving a paycheck involves other accounts besides simply
__Assets:Checking__ and
__Income:Salary__.

To add the paycheck split transaction from the__Assets:Checking__ account register window, click on a new transaction line and click Split. Note that if you have set your register view to Auto-Split or Transaction Journal, the splits will be opened for you. Enter the description of this transaction on the first line(e.g. &ldquo;Employers R Us&rdquo;). In the split lines below this, enter the various splits that make up this transaction, one by one. To enter the splits, first choose the account, then enter the amount by which to change the account. Keep in mind that when in an asset account register, amounts entered in the left column increase the account balance, while amounts entered in the right column decrease the balance (for more about this, see <<basics-transactions2>>). Tab or click the next split line and repeat the process. Note that if you are using the keyboard to navigate the transaction, use Tab to move from field to field, as using Enter will commit the transaction and create splits to an Imbalance account.


[NOTE]
====
When creating a transaction in GnuCash, splits can be entered in any order.
However, when the transaction is closed (either when leaving the transaction, or when
pressing the Enter key), all debit splits will jump ahead of all credit splits.

====

In this example, choose the deposit account
(__Assets:Checking__) and then enter the amount that
is being deposited into it (e.g. $670). Follow this by entering the
amounts for the various taxes:
__Expenses:Taxes:Federal__ account, $180;
__Expenses:Taxes:Medicare__ account, $90; and
__Expenses:Taxes:Social Security__ account, $60. Finally,
enter the gross total of your paycheck ($1,000 in this example) as a
withdrawal transfer from __Income:Salary__.

The final split should look like <<txns-register-multiaccount>>. Remember to press Enter after finishing the entry. But you
should also know that when you press Enter, the split view will be
"folded" back into a simplified transaction view. The
splits are still there; you just have to click
Split to view them. See <<txns-registers-features2>> for details.

[[txns-reconcile1]]

=== Reconciliation

Once transactions have been entered into GnuCash, it is important to verify
that they agree with the records of your financial institution. This
verification process is known as **reconciliation**, and it is key to determine
whether your records are accurate. Most commonly, you will check transactions
against bank statements, although you can use this process to verify any
transaction.

GnuCash keeps track of the reconciliation status of each
transaction. The reconciliation status of a transaction is shown by the
reconciliation R field in a register:
__y__ indicates that a transaction has been
reconciled, __n__ indicates that it has not, and __c__ indicates that it has
been cleared, but not reconciled. A split marked cleared signifies that you got some kind of confirmation
that the institution accepted the order (e.g. you have the restaurant's receipt for your credit card purchase).
You can toggle the reconciliation status
between __n__ and __c__ by clicking in the R field; you can set
it to __y__ by using <<txns-reconcile-window2>>.

At the bottom of the account window, there are (among others) two running
balances (the cleared and reconciled balance), and the
total balance. The former balances should correspond to how much money
the bank thinks you have in your account, while the latter includes outstanding transactions.

For example, when you write a check for something, you should
enter the transaction into GnuCash. The reconciliation R field of the
transaction will initially contain n (new). Your new entry will
contribute to the total balance, but not to the cleared and
reconciled balance. Later, if you got some confirmation that the check has been cashed,
you might click on the transaction&rsquo;s R field to change it to __c__
(cleared). When you do this, the cleared balance will
change to include this amount. When the bank statement arrives, you can
then compare it to what you&rsquo;ve recorded in GnuCash by opening the reconciliation
window. There, you will be able to change the R field to __y__ (reconciled).


[NOTE]
====
You cannot reconcile directly in a register window by clicking in the __R__ field. You must use the
reconciliation window. Once a transaction has been marked __reconciled__,
it can no longer be easily changed without breaking the
<<rec-start-blnc,Starting Balance>> of the next reconciliation.

====


[WARNING]
====
It is important to understand that reconciliation is done for a given
date, and when you reconcile an account based on a statement from a given date,
you are reconciling **all transactions prior to that date**. Therefore, if you
add or modify transactions that predate your last reconciliation, your
**reconciled** balances will be thrown off.

====

[[txns-reconcile-window2]]

==== Reconcile windows

The reconciliation windows are used to reconcile a GnuCash account
with a statement that a bank or other institution has sent you.
Reconciliation is useful not only to double-check your records against
those of your bank, but also to get a better idea of outstanding
transactions, e.g. uncashed checks.

To use the reconciliation windows, select an account from the
account tree and click on menu:Actions[Reconcile]. A window like the one below will appear in which you can
enter the reconcile information.

[[txns-reconcile-window-1]]
.Reconcile Window
image::figures/txns_reconcile_window1.png["The initial reconcile window.",width=]

In the initial reconcile window, some Reconcile Information need to be entered.

Statement Date:: The date of the statement you will be reconciling against.
+
[TIP]
====
Click on the down arrow in the right of this field to open a calendar

====

Starting Balance:: This is a non-editable item which displays the balance from the previous
reconciliation. It should match the starting balance in your statement.
+
[WARNING]
====
Sometimes, the opening balance in GnuCash does not match
that found on your statement. This can happen the first time you reconcile your account or
when a previously-reconciled transaction is de-reconciled or deleted.

====
+
[NOTE]
====
The first time you reconcile your account, the starting balance
will be 0.00, thus probably not the  __opening balance__
of your account. When you reconcile the account, the __opening balance__ for the
account will be included in the reconciliation, and the result should balance.

====
+
[TIP]
====
In the case when a previously-reconciled transaction is accidentally de-reconciled, you
can simply re-reconcile the transaction along with the transactions on the current statement, and
the result should balance.

The case of accidentally deleting a previously-reconciled transaction presents
more of a challenge; if you cannot determine what was
deleted and restore it to the register, you will have to create a dummy
transaction to get the reconciliation to finish.

====
+
[CAUTION]
====
While the latter case does not matter for your private accounting,
you should have a really good explanation for your auditors, if you are the
accountant of a club or a company.

====

Ending Balance:: This field should be filled with the ending balance as it appears in the statement.
+
[NOTE]
====
GnuCash automatically fills this field with the
Present balance as shown in the lower part of the
account&rsquo;s register.

====

Include Sub-accounts:: Check this option if you want to include in the reconciliation the transactions
that belongs to the sub-accounts of the currently selected account. Note that all sub-accounts must be in the same commodity as the parent for the option to be enabled.

Enter Interest Payment:: Clicking this button opens a new window that allow you to enter an interest transaction to the account to be
reconciled.
+
[TIP]
====
The Interest Payment window might be opened automatically when you start a reconciliation
for an account of the type __Bank__, __Credit__,
__Mutual__, __Asset__, __Receivable__,
__Payable__, and __Liability__. If you want to disable
this behavior for any of the previous accounts, go to the Register tab of the
GnuCash Preferences and uncheck the Automatic interest transfer
option. Alternatively, to disable this behavior only for the selected account, press the
No Auto Interest Payments for this Account button in the
Interest Payment window.

====

Then, click on the Ok button, and you will see
the transactions listing reconcile window:

[[txns-reconcile-window-2]]
.Reconcile Window
image::figures/txns_reconcile_window2.png["The transactions listing in the reconcile window.",width=]

The two panes called Funds In and
Funds Out, lists all the unreconciled transactions that belongs to the account
that is going to be reconciled.
The R columns show whether the transactions have been reconciled.

Now, examine each item on the bank statement, and look for the
matching item in the Reconcile window.

If you cannot find a transaction, then perhaps you forgot to enter it, or did not know that the transaction
had happened. You can use the New button on the __Toolbar__, or the
menu:Transaction[New]
menu item in the  menu, to open a register window and enter the missing
transaction. The new item will appear in the Reconcile window when you
press the Enter button in the register after entering the transaction.

When you find the item in the Reconcile window, compare the amount
in the item to the amount on the statement. If they disagree, you may
have made an error when you entered the transaction in GnuCash. You can
use the Edit button on the __Toolbar__, or the
menu:Transaction[Edit]
item, to open a register window and correct the transaction.

If the amounts agree, click on the item in the Reconcile window.
A check mark wil appear in the R column aside the selected transaction.
GnuCash will automatically update the amounts in the lower right summary pane.


[TIP]
====
You can use the up/down arrow keys to scroll to the item, the
space key to mark the item as reconciled and the Tab
key to switch panes.

====

You then repeat this for each item that appears on the bank
statement, verifying that the amounts match with the amounts in GnuCash,
and marking off transactions in GnuCash as they are reconciled.


[TIP]
====
You can check or uncheck the reconcile status of all transactions in 
either pane by clicking on a transaction in the required pane then clicking 
Ctrl-A followed by space. This will toggle 
the reconcile status of all transactions in the pane to either checked or 
unchecked state. This procedure can be repeated to achieve the desired status 
for the transactions in the pane.

====

At the bottom of the Reconcile window there is a Difference field,
which should show 0.00 when you are done reconciling. If it shows some
other value, then either you have missed transactions, or some amounts
may be incorrect in GnuCash. (Or, less likely, the bank may have made an
error.)


[NOTE]
====
Under some circumstances, it may be difficult or impossible to determine why an account will not reconcile. If you are unable to correct the discrepancy between your books and a statement, GnuCash includes a Balance button on the __Toolbar__ that will automatically create a balancing entry for you in the amount that cannot be reconciled.

To use this, carry out the full reconciliation (marking all transactions that you can identify) and then click this button. GnuCash will create a balancing entry for the remaining discrepancy that uses the __Special Accounts:Orphan-XXX__ account (where "XXX" represents your currency). The Reconcile window will close; re-opening it will allow you to check the newly-created balancing entry and finish the process.

====

When you have marked off all the items on the bank statement and the difference is 0.00, press the Finish button on the __Toolbar__ or
select menu:Reconcile[Finish] from the menu.
The Reconcile window will close.
In the register window, the R field of the reconciled transactions will
change to __y__.

In this case, we have not received all the information yet, so we
simply press the Postpone button, so we can continue at
a later stage. Observe that the R column indicates we cleared (__c__)
two transactions. They have not been reconciled yet, but we have
verified these two transactions so they have been marked as cleared. If
you look at the __Statusbar__ at the bottom of the account register, you
will see a summary of what has been reconciled and what has been cleared
(Cleared:USD 954.79 Reconciled:USD 0.00)

[[txns-reconcile-window-3]]

[[txns-sxn1]]

=== Scheduled Transactions

Scheduled transactions are made to help entering repetitive money
operations, like subscriptions, insurances or taxes. By using scheduled
transactions, you only have to enter the concerned transaction once, set a
few parameters like start date, frequency and a little description, and
then GnuCash will tell you whenever a scheduled transaction is ready to be
created, and create it for you.

In this howto, we&rsquo;ll take a monthly Internet subscription of 20 USD
as example, which is taken on the 28th of each month.

In GnuCash, there are two ways of creating scheduled transactions,
<<txns-sxn-ledger2,from the ledger>> or from the
<<txns-sxn-editor2,Scheduled Transactions Editor>>.

[[txns-sxn-ledger2]]

==== Creating from the Ledger

Enter the first occurrence of your to-schedule transaction in the
ledger. In the Transfer field for this transaction, type
__Expenses:Internet__ as shown in the next screenshot.

[[txns-sxn-ledger-1]]
.Step one creating scheduled transaction from the ledger
image::figures/txns_sxn_ledger1.png["Step one creating scheduled transaction from the ledger",width=]


[NOTE]
====
Since we did not create the __Expenses:Internet__ account, GnuCash
will prompt us to create it.

====

Then you right click on your transaction and select
Schedule...

[[txns-sxn-ledger-2]]
.Step two creating scheduled transaction from the ledger
image::figures/txns_sxn_ledger2.png["Step two creating scheduled transaction from the ledger",width=]

A window like this will appear:

[[txns-sxn-ledger-3]]
.Step three creating scheduled transaction from the ledger
image::figures/txns_sxn_ledger3.png["Step three creating scheduled transaction from the ledger",width=]

Let&rsquo;s fill the values, we know that the subscription is taken on
the 28th each month, and the next one is for next month (since we
entered the one for this month manually) :

[[txns-sxn-ledger-4]]
.Filling in data to a scheduled transaction
image::figures/txns_sxn_ledger4.png["Filling in data to a scheduled transaction",width=]

Click the OK button, and the transaction will be scheduled.
GnuCash now has memorized this scheduled transaction and on the 28th of
next month, it will pop up a window asking if it should create it (see
far below for a screenshot of this window).

[[txns-sxn-editor2]]

==== Creating from the Editor

Another way of entering a scheduled transaction is from the
Scheduled Transaction Editor, it may be faster if we have several
scheduled transactions to create at once.

From the main accounts windows, select
menu:Actions[Scheduled Transactions &gt; Scheduled Transaction Editor] from the __Menubar__.
A new Scheduled Transactions tab will be opened in the
current GnuCash window as shown above:

[[txns-sxn-editor-2]]
.Empty Scheduled Transactions tab
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor-2.png["Empty Scheduled Transactions tab",width=]

This tab contains a list, now empty, of all the scheduled
transactions. Let&rsquo;s create a new one by clicking on the New
button in the __Toolbar__. A window like the one below will pop up:

[[txns-sxn-editor-3-overview]]
. Edit Scheduled Transaction &gt;  window,  Overview tab
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor-3-overview.png["Edit Scheduled Transaction window, Overview tab",width=]

First, let&rsquo;s enter a name for this new scheduled
transaction in the top of the window.


[NOTE]
====
This name will only identify the transaction
in the Edit Scheduled Transaction window,
it will never appear in the ledger.

====

In the Options pane of the Overview
tab you have four options:

Enable:: Sets the status of the scheduled transaction.

Create automatically:: If enabled, will insert this transaction in the
ledger without asking you before (see below). If needed, you can be advised
when the transaction is entered by checking the Notify me when created
option.

Create in advance:: Sets how many days in advance the transaction will be created.

Remind in advance:: Sets how many days in advance a reminder is presented. This
can be used, for example, when you have to pay something by check, and a reminder
one week before allows you to send your check before the deadline.

The Occurences pane allows you to tell GnuCash that
this scheduled transaction won&rsquo;t last for ever. For example if you are repaying a loan,
you can enter the loan end date or the number of occurences left.

Select now the Frequency tab in the Edit Scheduled Transaction window.
Here you can set the time-related options of the transaction.

[[txns-sxn-editor-3-frequency]]
. Edit Scheduled Transaction &gt;  window, Frequency tab
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor-3-frequency.png["Edit Scheduled Transaction window, Frequency tab",width=]

Frequency:: Sets the basic frequency of the transaction, with options for once,
daily, weekly, semi-monthly and
monthly.
In this example, this is set to monthly.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is possible to set a transaction to occur at intervals __other__ than
those listed in the Frequency list, by changing the setting in the
Every control (see below).

====

Start Date:: Sets when the transaction will begin. In the example, this would
be set to the start of the next month.

Every:: This option allows you to schedule transactions by multiplies of the value in
Frequency. For example, to create a transaction that runs every 3 weeks, set
Frequency to Weeks and Every to
3.

On the and Except on weekends:: Sets the day of the month that the transaction is scheduled, and controls what
GnuCash will do when the day occurs on a weekend day.


[NOTE]
====
We know that the subscription is taken on the 28th each month, so the Start date
will be November 1, 2003 (assuming November is the next month), the Frequency will be
Monthly, it will be taken every month on the 28th. Since in our example the internet
subscription is automatically taken from the account, we have no need to create it in advance, nor
give an end date.

====

When the elements on this tab are filled in, GnuCash will highlights the
calendar below to indicate when future transactions will be run.

Finally select the Template Transaction tab and enter your transaction
in the lower part as you would do in the ledger, with the only difference of having no date.

Now, you should have a window like this:

[[txns-sxn-editor-3-template]]
.Edit Scheduled Transaction &gt;  window, Template Transaction tab
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor-3-template.png["Edit Scheduled Transaction window, Template Transaction tab",width=]

Remember to click on the Enter icon, to validate and enter the
transaction.

Now click OK, it takes you to the Scheduled Transactions tab,
now showing one item in the Transactions list:

[[txns-sxn-editor-4]]
.Entered scehduled transaction
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor-4.png["Entered scehduled transaction",width=]


[TIP]
====
If you click in the calendar part on the first day of one month, a
small window, following your mouse, will show you what is planned for
this day. To make the small window dissapear again, just click in it
one more time.

====

You can now close the Scheduled Transaction tab, and
save your work.


[NOTE]
====
What comes below is just an illustration, and is not meant to be
entered into the GnuCash database at this stage. As per this example,
the below dialogs will appear when the scheduled transaction is
supposed to run.

====

From now on, when GnuCash is launched and a scheduled
transaction is scheduled or need to be entered,
you may see a Since Last Run... window summarizing the scheduled transactions
operations (Reminder, To-Create etc... a better
description of each option can be found in the GnuCash manual):

[[txns-sxn-editor-slr]]
.Scheduled transaction popup reminder
image::figures/txns_sxn_editor_slr.png["Scheduled transaction popup reminder",width=]

You can click on the Status column to change
the scheduled transaction status if needed. Then just click on Ok to
close the Since Last Run... window and to apply the pending operations.
Select Cancel to skip entering in the ledger the pending operations.

If the Status field was set to To-Create,
then if you take a look in your bank account register, you&rsquo;ll see the transaction has been created:


[TIP]
====
If you enable the Review created transactions option in the lower right of the
Since Last Run... window, GnuCash will open, after pressing
Ok, the register tab of each account where the scheduled
transactions were entered automatically.

====


[NOTE]
====
If you entered the transaction for 28 of April at this stage,
then please __revert back__ to the last saved GnuCash file
by selecting menu:File[Open] and
choosing the previously saved __$$gcashdata_3$$__GnuCash file.

=== Putting It All Together

In the previous sections of this chapter the concepts and mechanics
of working with transactions in GnuCash have been discussed. This section
will expand upon the chart of accounts initially built in the previous
chapter, by setting some opening balances, adding transactions and a
scheduled transaction.

[[txns-puttoget-openfile]]

==== Open GnuCash file

Start with opening the previous datafile we stored,
__$$gcashdata_3emptyAccts$$__, and store it as
__$$gcashdata_4$$__ directly. The main window should look
something like this:

[[txns-puttoget1-Charts]]
.Starting point for Putting It All Together
image::figures/txns_puttoget_Charts.png["This image shows the starting point for this section.",width=]

[[txns-puttoget-open2]]

==== Opening Balances

As shown earlier with the __Assets:Checking__
account, the starting balances in an account are typically assigned to a
special account called __Equity:Opening Balance__. To
start filling in this chart of account, begin by setting the starting
balances for the accounts. Assume that there is $1000 in the savings
account and $500 charged on the credit card.


. Open the __Assets:Savings__ account register.
Select  from the menu and check to make sure
you are in Basic Ledger style. You will view your transactions in
the other modes later, but for now let&rsquo;s enter a basic transaction
using the basic default style.


. From the __Assets:Savings__ account register
window, enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your starting
balance to $1000, transferred from __Equity:Opening Balance__.
Remember, basic transactions transfer money from
a source account to a destination account. Record the transaction
(press the Enter key, or click on
the Enter icon).


. From the __Assets:Checking__ account register
window, enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your starting
balance to $1000, transferred from __Equity:Opening Balance__.


. From the __Liabilities:Visa__ account
register window, enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your
starting balance to $500, transferred from __Equity:Opening Balance__.
This is done by entering the $500 as a charge
in the __Visa__ account (or decrease in the __Opening Balance__ account),
since it is money you borrowed. Record the transaction (press the
Enter key, or click on
the Enter icon).

You should now have 3 accounts with opening balances set.
__Assets:Checking__,
__Assets:Savings__, and
__Liabilities:Visa__.

==== Additional Transaction Examples

Now add some more transactions to simulate a month&rsquo;s expenses.
During the month, $78 is spent on electricity, $45 on phone, and $350 on
rent. All paid by check. We also spent $45.21 on groceries, received $670
as salary, and paid our Internet bill this month. Finally, let&rsquo;s move
$100 from the savings account to the checking account.


. Open the __Expenses:Electricity__ account
register and enter a simple 2 account transaction to pay the $78
electrical bill at the end of the current month (eg: March 28,
2006). Enter a description (eg: Light Company) and the check number
(eg: 102). The Transfer account should be
__Assets:Checking__.


. Open the __Assets:Checking__ account register
and enter a simple 2 account transaction to pay the $45 phone bill
at the end of the current month (eg: March 28, 2006). Enter a
description (eg: Phone Company Name) and the check number (eg: 103).
The Transfer account should be
__Expenses:Phone__. Notice that you can enter
expense transactions from either the credit side (the expense
accounts) or the debit side (the asset account).


. Open the __Expenses:Rent__ account register
and enter a simple 2 account transaction to pay the $350 in rent at
the end of the current month (eg: March 28, 2006). Enter a
description (eg: April Rent) and the check number (eg: 104). The
Transfer account should be
__Assets:Checking__.


. Duplicate this transaction using the
Duplicate button in the __Toolbar__. Start by
clicking on the current rent transaction, and click on the
Duplicate icon. Enter the transaction date a
month out in the future (eg: April 28, 2006), and notice the blue
line separator that GnuCash uses to separate future transactions
from current ones. In this way, you can enter transactions before
they occur.
+
You could also set up a scheduled transaction to pay your
rent, since the value of the rent is likely to be constant for the
foreseeable future. 

** Start by clicking on the current (April 28) rent
transaction, and click on the Schedule
icon

** Change to Monthly, change
description if needed and press OK





. To transfer money from your savings account to your checking
account, open the __Assets:Savings__ account
register, add a new transaction setting
the Transfer to __Assets:Checking__ in the amount
of $100 (date 6 March, 2006).


. As another example of a simple 2 account transaction, add
another transaction to describe the purchase of $45.21 worth of
groceries on 5 of March. From within the __Assets:Checking__ account, you
would set Transfer to
__Expenses:Groceries__. The account register should
now appear:


. To add a paycheck transaction from the
__Assets:Checking__ account register window, click
on a new transaction line, and click on Split.
First enter the description of this transaction on the first line
(eg: "Employers R Us"), as well as the date (14 March). In the
"split" line below this, enter the deposit into
__Assets:Checking__ (eg:$670). Follow this with the various tax deposits
(__Assets:Checking__ (eg: $670),
__Expenses:Taxes:Federal__ account (eg: $180),
__Expenses:Taxes:Medicare__ account (eg: $90), and
__Expenses:Taxes:Social Security__ account (eg: $60)) and
lastly the gross total of your paycheck (eg: $1000) as a withdrawal
transfer from __Income:Salary__.


. You also need to pay for your Internet subscription of 20 USD on
the 28th.

==== Save file

Before we go to the report section, let&rsquo;s save the GnuCash data
file (__$$gcashdata_4$$__).

[[txns-puttoget-reports]]

==== Reports

But only having data available on the computer screen will not
make your accountant happy, therefore GnuCash comes with a large number
of highly customizable reports.

Let&rsquo;s have a look at a Cash Flow, and a
Transaction Report.


. First let&rsquo;s have a look at the Cash Flow
report for the month of March.
+
Select the cash flow report from menu:Reports[Income &amp; Expense &gt; Cash Flow].
+
[[txns-puttoget2-Cash]]
.Cash Flow report for the month of March
image::figures/txns_CashFlow.png["This image shows the Cash Flow report after .",width=]
+
To get this customized report, right click in the report and
choose Report Options. Then set the time
period, and specify which accounts you want in the report.


. Now let&rsquo;s have a look at corresponding transaction report for
the Checking account.
+
Select the transaction report from menu:Reports[Transaction Report].
+
[[txns-puttoget2-TransactionRptChecking]]

. Now let&rsquo;s change the transaction report to only show the
various Expenses accounts.
