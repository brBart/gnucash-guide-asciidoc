the unrealized and realized gains and losses, better known as capital gains
and losses.

=== Basic Concepts

This chapter will present some of the techniques used to keep track
of the unrealized and realized gains and losses, better known as capital
gains and losses.

Certain resellable assets can change value over time, such as
stocks, bonds, houses, or cars. Some assets (eg: a stock) could increase
in value, some (eg: a car) could decrease in value. It is important to be
able to track some of these time-dependent asset valuations, this chapter
will show you how.

Probably everything you own will increase or decrease in value over
time. So, the question is for which of these assets should you track this
changing value? The simple answer is that you only need to track this for
items which could be sold for cash in the future or which relate to
taxation.

Consumable and disposable items (eg: food, gas for your car, or
printer paper) are obviously not involved. Thus, even though the new
clothes you recently bought will certainly depreciate, you would not want
to track this depreciation since you have no intention of reselling the
clothes and there is no tax implications to the depreciation on clothing.
So, for this example, the purchase of new clothes should be recorded as a
pure expense... you spent the money, and it is gone.

Asset appreciation occurs when something you own increases in value
over time. When you own an asset which has increased in value, the
difference between the original purchase price and the new value is known
as __unrealized gains__. When you sell the asset, the
profit you earn is known as __realized gains__ or
__capital gains__. An example of an asset from which you
could have unrealized gains, and eventually capital gains, is stock in a
publicly traded company.

=== Estimating Valuation

As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, capital gains are
the profits received from the sale of an asset. This section will describe
how to record capital gains in GnuCash.

The accounting methods for handling asset appreciation differs
somewhat from depreciation because typically you are only concerned with
the moment you sell the asset and realize the capital gains. This is
opposed to the continuous nature of tracking depreciation. Capital gains
are an important subject in the world of taxation, because governments
tend to be quite interested in taxing capital gains in one manner or
another.


[NOTE]
====
As always, there are exceptions. If you hold a bond that pays all
of its interest at maturity, tax authorities often require that you
recognize interest each year, and refuse this to be treated as a capital
gain. Consult the appropriate tax codes to determine the preferred
treatment for each type of asset you have which may be affected by
capital gains taxes.

====

Estimating the increasing value of assets is generally not simple,
because often it is difficult to know its exact value until the moment it
is sold.

Securities traded daily on open markets such as stock exchanges are
possibly the easiest type of asset to predict the value of, and selling
the asset at market prices may be as simple as calling a broker and
issuing a Market Order. On the other hand, estimating the value of a house
is more difficult. Homes are sold less often than stocks, and the sales
tend to involve expending considerable effort and negotiations, which
means that estimates are likely to be less precise. Similarly, selling a
used automobile involves a negotiation process that makes pricing a bit
less predictable.

Values of collectible objects such as jewelry, works of art,
baseball cards, and "Beanie Babies" are even harder to estimate. The
markets for such objects are much less open than the securities markets
and less open than the housing market. Worse still are one-of-a-kind
assets. Factories often contain presses and dies customized to build a
very specific product that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars;
this equipment may be worthless outside of that very specific context. In
such cases, several conflicting values might be attached to the asset,
none of them unambiguously correct.

The general rule of thumb in accounting for estimating unrealized
gains (or loses) is that you should only revalue assets such as stocks
which are readily sellable and for which there are very good estimates of
the value. For all other assets, it is better to simply wait until you
sell them, at which time you can exactly determine the capital gains. Of
course, there is no hard rule on this, and in fact different accountants
may prefer to do this differently.

[[capgain_accounts1]]

=== Account Setup

As with most accounting practices, there are a number of different
ways to setup capital gains accounts. We will present here a general
method which should be flexible enough to handle most situations. The
first account you will need is an __Asset Cost__ account
(GnuCash account type Asset), which is simply a place where you record
the original purchase of the asset. Usually this purchase is accomplished
by a transaction from your bank account.

In order to keep track of the appreciation of the asset, you will
need three accounts. The first is an __Unrealized Gains__
asset account in which to collect the sum of all of the appreciation
amounts. The __Unrealized Gains__ asset account is balanced by a
__Unrealized Gains__ income account, in which all
periodic appreciation income is recorded. Finally, another income account
is necessary, called a __Realized Gains__ in which you
record the actual capital gains upon selling the asset.

Below is a generic account hierarchy for tracking the appreciation
of 2 assets, __ITEM1__ and __ITEM2__. The __Assets:Fixed Assets:ITEM1:Cost__ accounts are
balanced by the __Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__ account,
the __Assets:Fixed Assets:ITEM1:Unrealized Gains__
accounts are balanced by the __Income:Unrealized Gains__ account (similar for __ITEM2__).

=== Example

Let&rsquo;s suppose you buy an asset expected to increase in value, say a
Degas painting, and want to track this. (The insurance company will care
about this, even if nobody else does.)

Start with an account hierarchy similar to that shown in <<capgain_accounts1>>, but replace "ITEM1" with "Degas" and you
can remove the "ITEM2" accounts. We will assume that the Degas painting
had an initial value of one hundred thousand dollars. Begin by giving your
self $100,000 in the bank and then transferring that from your bank
account to your __Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Cost__ account (the asset
purchase transaction). You should now have a main account window which
appears like this:

[[capgain_exampleunrealized2]]

==== Unrealized Gains

A month later, you have reason to suspect that the value of your
painting has increased by $10,000 (an unrealized gain). In order to
record this you transfer $10,000 from your __Accrued Gains__ income account
(__Income:Unrealized Gains__) to your asset Unrealized Gains account
(__Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gain__). Your main window will
resemble this:

[[capgain_examplesell2]]

==== Selling

Let&rsquo;s suppose another month later prices for Degas paintings have
gone up some more, in this case about $20,000, you estimate. You duly
record the $20,000 as an unrealized income like above, then decide to
sell the painting.

Three possibilities arise. You may have __accurately estimated__ the unrealized gain,
__underestimated__ the unrealized gain, or
__overestimated__ the unrealized gain.


. __Accurate estimation__ of unrealized
gain.
+
Your optimistic estimate of the painting&rsquo;s value was correct.
First you must record that the profits made are now realized gains,
not unrealized gains. Do this by transferring the income from the
__Income:Unrealized Gains__ to the
__Income:Realized Gains__ account.
+
Secondly, you must credit your bank account with the selling
price of the painting. This money comes directly from your
__Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas__ sub-accounts. Transfer the full
__Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Cost__ value into
__Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__, and the full
__Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gain__ into
__Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__.
+
These transactions should now appear as follows:
+
.Turning an Accrued Gain into a Realized Gain

|===============
|__Account__|__Transfer to__|__Transaction Amount__|__Account Total__
|Income:Unrealized Gains|Income:Realized Gains|$30,000|$0
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Cost|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$100,000|$0
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gains|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$30,000|$0

|===============

+
This leaves the __Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__ account
with a total of $130000 and __Income:Realized Gains__ with a total of
$30000.
+

. __Under estimation__ of unrealized
gain.
+
You were over-optimistic about the value of the painting.
Instead of the $130000 you thought the painting was worth you are only
offered $120000. But you still decide to sell, because you value
$120000 more than you value the painting. The numbers change a
little bit, but not too dramatically.
+
The transactions should now appear as follows (observe the
last transaction which balances the __Unrealized Gains__
accounts):
+
.Turning an Accrued Gain into a Realized Gain

|===============
|__Account__|__Transfer to__|__Transaction Amount__|__Account Total__
|Income:Unrealized Gains|Income:Realized Gains|$20,000|$10,000
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Cost|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$100,000|$0
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gains|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$20,000|$10,000
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gains|Income:Unrealized Gains|$10,000|$0

|===============

+
This leaves the __Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__ account
with a total of $120000 and __Income:Realized Gains__ with a total of
$20000.


. __Over estimation__ of unrealized
gain.
+
You manage to sell your painting for more than you thought in
your wildest dreams ($150,000). The extra value is, again, recorded
as a gain, i.e. an income.
+
The transactions should now appear as follows (observe the
last transaction which balances the Unrealized Gains
accounts):
+
.Turning an Accrued Gain into a Realized Gain

|===============
|__Account__|__Transfer to__|__Transaction Amount__|__Account Total__
|Income:Unrealized Gains|Income:Realized Gains|$50,000|$-20,000
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Cost|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$100,000|$0
|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gains|Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account|$50,000|$-20,000
|Income:Unrealized Gains|Assets:Fixed Assets:Degas:Unrealized Gains|$20,000|$0

|===============

+
This leaves the __Assets:Current Assets:Savings Account__ account
with a total of $150,000 and __Income:Realized Gains__ with a total of
$50,000.

[[capgain_tax1]]

=== Taxation

Taxation policies vary considerably between countries, so it is
virtually impossible to say anything that will be universally useful.
However, it is common for income generated by capital gains to not be
subject to taxation until the date that the asset is actually sold, and
sometimes not even then. North American home owners usually find that when
they sell personal residences, capital gains that occur are exempt from
taxation. It appears that other countries treat sale of homes differently,
taxing people on such gains. German authorities, for example, tax those
gains only if you owned the property for less than ten years.

Chris Browne has a story from his professional tax preparation days
where a family sold a farm, and expected a considerable tax bill that
turned out to be virtually nil due to having owned the property before
1971 (wherein lies a critical "Valuation Day" date in Canada) and due to
it being a dairy farm, with some really peculiar resulting deductions. The
point of this story is that while the presentation here is fairly simple,
taxation often gets terribly complicated...
