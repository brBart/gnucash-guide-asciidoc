== Investments

This chapter explains how to manage your investments with GnuCash.
Most people have an investment plan, whether its just putting money into a
CD account, investing through a company sponsored plan at your workplace or
buying and selling stocks and bonds through a brokerage. GnuCash gives you
tools to help you manage these investments such as the __Price Editor__ which allows you to record changes in the prices of
stocks you own.

[[invest_concepts1]]

=== Basic Concepts

An investment is something that you purchase in the hopes of
generating income, or that you hope to sell in the future for more than
you paid. Using this simple definition, many things could be considered
investments: the house you live in, a valuable painting, stocks in
publicly traded companies, your savings account at the bank, or a
certificate of deposit. These many types of investments will be discussed
in this chapter in terms of how to track them using GnuCash.

[[invest_terms2]]

==== Terminology

Before discussing investments specifically, it will be helpful to
present a glossary of investment terminology. The terms presented below
represent some of the basic concepts of investing. It is a good idea to
become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to this list
if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.

__Capital gains__:: The difference between
the purchase and selling prices of an investment. If the selling
price is lower than the purchase price, this is called a
__capital loss__. Also known as __realized gain/loss__.

__Commission__:: The fee you pay to a broker
to buy or sell securities.

__Common stock__:: A security that
represents a certain fractional ownership of a company. This is what
you buy when you "buy stock" in a company on the open market. This
is also sometimes known as __capital stock__.

__Compounding__:: The concept that the
reinvested interest can later earn interest of its own (interest on
interest). This is often referred to as __compound interest__.

__Dividends__:: Dividends are cash payments a company
makes to shareholders. The amount of this payment is usually
determined as some amount of the profits of the company. Note that
not all common stocks give dividends.

__Equities__:: Equities are investments in which the
investor becomes part (or whole) owner in something. This includes
common stock in a company, or real estate.

__Interest__:: What a borrower pays a lender
for the use of their money. Normally, this is expressed in terms of
a percentage of the principal per year. For example, a savings
account with 1% interest (you are the lender, the bank is the
borrower) will pay you $1 for every $100 you keep there per
year.

__Liquidity__:: A measure of how easily
convertible an investment is to cash. Money in a savings account is
very liquid, while money invested in a house has low liquidity
because it takes time to sell a house.

__Principal__:: The original amount of money
invested or borrowed.

__Realized vs Unrealized Gain/Loss__:: Unrealized gain or loss occurs when you&rsquo;ve got a change in price of
an asset. You realize the gain/loss when you actually sell the
asset. See also __capital gain/loss__.

__Return__:: The total income plus capital
gains or losses of an investment. See also
__Yield__.

__Risk__:: The probability that the return
on investment is different from what was expected. Investments are
often grouped on a scale from low risk (savings account, government
bonds) to high risk (common stock, junk bonds). As a general rule of
thumb, the higher the risk the higher the possible return.

__Shareholder__:: A shareholder is a person who holds common
stock in a company.

__Stock split__:: Occurs when a company offers
to issue some additional multiple of shares for each existing stock.
For example, a "2 for 1" stock split means that if you own 100
shares of a stock, you will receive an additional 100 at no cost to
you. The unit price of the shares will be adjusted so there is no
net change in the value, so in this example the price per share will
be halved.

__Valuation__:: The process of determining
the market value or the price the investment would sell at in a
"reasonable time frame".

__Yield__:: A measure of the amount of money
you earn from an investment (IE: how much income you receive from
the investment). Typically this is reported as a percentage of the
principal amount. Yield does not include capital gains or loses (see
Return). Eg: A stock sells for $100 and gives $2 in dividends per
year has a yield of 2%.

[[invest_types2]]

==== Types of Investments

Below is presented some of the broad types of investments
available, and examples of each type.



** __Interest-bearing account or instrument__
+
This type of investment usually allows you immediate access to
your money, and will typically pay you interest every month based on
the amount of money you have deposited. Examples are bank savings
accounts (and some interest bearing checking accounts) and cash
accounts at your brokerage. This is a very low risk investment, in
the US these accounts are often insured against loss, to a specified
limit.
+
Sometimes an interest bearing investment is
__time-locked__. This type of investment requires
you to commit your money to be invested for a given period of time
for which you receive a set rate of return. Usually, the longer you
commit the higher the interest rates. If you withdraw your money
before the maturity date, you will usually have to pay an early
withdrawal penalty. This is a relatively lower risk investment.
Examples are certificates of deposit or some government bonds. Other
types of Bonds may have higher yields based on the higher risks from
the quality of the issuer&rsquo;s "credit rating".

** __Stocks and Mutual Funds__
+
This is an investment you make in a company, in which you
effectively become a part owner. There is usually no time lock on
publicly traded stock, however there may be changes in the tax rates
you pay on capital gains depending on how long you hold the stock.
Thus, stocks are typically quite liquid, you can access your money
relatively quickly. This investment is a higher risk, as you have no
guarantee on the future price of a stock.
+
A mutual fund is a group investment mechanism in which you can
buy into many stocks simultaneously. For example, a "S&amp;P 500
index fund" is a fund which purchases all 500 stocks listed in the
Standard and Poor&rsquo;s index. When you buy a share of this fund, you
are really buying a small amount of each of the 500 stocks contained
within the fund. Mutual funds are treated exactly like a single
stock, both for tax purposes and in accounting.

** __Fixed Assets__
+
Assets that increase in value over time are another form of
investment. Examples include a house, a plot of land, or a valuable
painting. This type of investment is very difficult to determine the
value of until you sell it. The tax implications of selling these
items is varied, depending on the item. For example, you may have
tax relief from selling a house if it is your primary residence, but
may not receive this tax break on an expensive painting.
+
Fixed asset investments are discussed in <<chapter_capgain>> and
<<chapter_dep>>. Typically, there is not much to do
in terms of accounting for fixed asset investments except recording
the buying and selling transactions.


[[invest_accounts1]]

=== Setting Up Accounts

To setup investment accounts in GnuCash you can either use the
predefined investment account hierarchy or create your own. The minimum
you need to do to track investments is to setup an asset account for each
type of investment you own. However, as we have seen in previous chapters,
it is usually more logical to create a structured account hierarchy,
grouping related investments together. For example, you may want to group
all your publicly traded stocks under a parent account named after the
brokerage firm you used to buy the stocks.


[NOTE]
====
Regardless of how you setup your account hierarchy, remember that
you can always move accounts around later (without losing the work you&rsquo;ve
put into them), so your initial account hierarchy does not have to be
perfect.

====

[[invest_predefined2]]

==== Using Predefined Investment Accounts

The Investment Accounts option of the
New Account Hierarchy Setup assistant will
automatically create a basic investment account hierarchy for you. To
access the predefined investment accounts hierarchy, you must make
sure your GnuCash file is open, switch to the
Accounts tab, and choose
menu:Actions[New Account
      Hierarchy]. This will run the New
      Account Hierarchy Setup assistant and allow you to select
additional accounts to add to your account hierarchy. Choose the
Investment Accounts option (along with any
others you are interested in). Assuming only investment accounts were
selected, this will create an account hierarchy as shown
below.


[TIP]
====
You can also run the New Account Hierarchy
        Setup assistant by creating a new GnuCash file.

====

[[invest_accountspredef]]
.Setup Interest Investment
image::figures/invest_AccountsPredef.png["This is a screen image of the Accounts tab after creating a new file and selecting only the default investment accounts.",width=]

You will probably at least want to add a __Bank__
account to the Assets and probably an __Equity:Opening Balances__
account, as we have done in previous chapters. Don&rsquo;t
forget to save your new account file with a relevant name!

[[invest_creating2]]

==== Creating Investment Accounts Manually

If you want to set up your own investment accounts hierarchy,
you may of course do so. Investments usually have a number of
associated accounts that need to be created: an asset account to
track the investment itself; an income account to track dividend
transactions; and expense accounts to track investment fees and
commissions.

In a typical account structure, security accounts are sub accounts
of an asset account representing an account at a brokerage firm. The
brokerage account would be denominated in your local currency and it
would include sub accounts for each security that you trade there.


Related purchases, sales, income and expense accounts should also
be in the same currency as the brokerage account.


The security sub accounts would each be configured to contain units
of a single security selected from the master (user defined) security
list and they are expected to use the same currency as the brokerage
account.


Security prices are kept in a separate area of GnuCash
         (the Price Database - menu:Tools
        [Price Editor]). This
contains prices for individual securities (not security accounts). All
prices for an individual security are in a single currency. If a
security is traded in multiple currencies, then a separate security and
separate accounts should be set up for each currency.


[[invest_custom2]]

==== Custom Accounts Example

The following is a somewhat more complicated example of setting up
GnuCash to track your investments, which has the advantage that it
groups each different investment under the brokerage that deals with the
investments. This way it is easier to compare the statements you get
from your brokerage with the accounts you have in GnuCash and spot where
GnuCash differs from the statement.

[TIP]
====
There really is no standard way to set up your investment account
hierarchy. Play around, try different layouts until you find something
which divides your investment accounts into logical groups which make
sense to you.

====

[[invest_int1]]

=== Interest Bearing Accounts

Investments which have a fixed or variable rate of interest are one
of the simplest and most common form of investments available. Interest
bearing investments include your bank account, a certificate of deposit,
or any other kind of investment in which you receive interest from the
principal. This section will describe how to handle these kinds of
investments in GnuCash.

[[invest_intacct2]]

==== Account Setup

When you purchase the interest bearing investment, you must create
an asset account to record the purchase of the investment, an income
account to record earnings from interest, and an expense account to
record bank charges. Below is an account layout example, in which you
have an interest bearing savings account and a certificate of deposit at
your bank.


....

Assets
   Bank ABC
      CD
      Savings
Expenses
   Bank ABC
      Charges
Income
   Interest Income
      CD
      Savings
  
....
As usual, this account hierarchy is simply presented as an
example, you should create your accounts in a form which best matches
your actual situation.

[[invest-intex2]]

==== Example

Now let&rsquo;s populate these accounts with real numbers. Let&rsquo;s assume
that you start with $10000 in your bank account, which pays 1% interest
and you buy a $5000 certificate of deposit with a 6 month maturity date
and a 2% yield. Clearly, it is much better to keep your money in the CD
than in the savings account. After the initial purchase, your accounts
should look something like this:

[[invest-int]]
.Setup Interest Investment
image::figures/invest_int1.png["This is an image of the account register after creating and investing in a CD investment.",width=]

Now, during the course of the next 6 months, you receive monthly
bank statements which describe the activity of your account. In our
fictional example, we do nothing with the money at this bank, so the
only activity is income from interest and bank charges. The monthly bank
charges are $2. After 6 months, the register window for the CD and for the savings
account should look like these:

[[invest-int2]]
.Setup Interest Investment
image::figures/invest_int2.png["This is an image of the register of the CD account after 6 months.",width=]

[[invest-int2-1]]
.Setup Interest Investment
image::figures/invest_int2-1.png["This is an image of the register of the Savings account after 6 months.",width=]

And this is the main GnuCash account window:

[[invest-int3]]
.Setup Interest Investment
image::figures/invest_int3.png["This a screen capture of the accounts after 6 months.",width=]

From the above image of the main GnuCash account window you see a
nice summary of what happened to these investments over the 6 months.
While the yield on the CD is double that of the savings account, the
return on the CD was $50.21 versus $13.03 for the savings account, or
almost 4 times more. Why? Because of the pesky $2 bank charges that hit
the savings account (which counted for $12 over 6 months).

After this 6 month period, the CD has reached maturity which means
you may sell it with no early withdrawal penalty. To do so, simply
transfer the $5050.21 from the CD account into the savings
account.

[[invest-setup1]]

=== Setup Investment Portfolio

Now that you have built an account hierarchy in the previous
section, this section will show you how to create and populate the accounts with your
investment portfolio. After this initial setup of your portfolio, you may have
shares of stock purchased from before you started using GnuCash. For these stocks,
follow the instructions in the <<invest-buy-stock2,Entering
    Preexisting Shares>> section below. If you have just purchased your stocks,
then use the <<invest-buy-new2,Buying New Shares
    >> section.

[[invest-setup-stockaccounts2]]

==== Setup Accounts for Stocks and Mutual Funds

This section will show you how to add stocks and mutual fund
accounts to GnuCash. In this section, we will assume you are using the
basic account setup introduced in the previous section, but
the principles can be applied to any account hierarchy.

You should have within the top level Asset
account, a few levels down, an account entitled
Stock. Open the account tree to this level by
clicking on the "right facing triangle marker" signs next
to the account names until the tree is opened to the depth of the new
account. You will need to create a sub-account (of type
__stock__) under the Stock account for every stock you
own. Every stock is a separate account. The naming of these stock
accounts is usually done using the stock ticker abbreviation, though account
names may be anything that is clear to you and other users. So, for
example, you could name your accounts __AMZN__,
__IBM__ and __NST__ for your Amazon,
IBM and NSTAR stocks respectively. Below is a schematic model of the
layout (only showing the Assets sub-accounts).


....

 Assets
    Investments
       Brokerage Accounts
          Bond
          Mutual Funds
          Market Index
          Stock
             AMZN
             IBM
             NST
 
....

[NOTE]
====
If you want to track income (dividends/interest/capital gains)
on a per-stock or fund basis, you will need to create an
__Income:Dividends:STOCKSYMBOL__,
__Income:Cap Gain (Long):STOCKSYMBOL__,
__Income:Cap Gain (Short):STOCKSYMBOL__
and __Income:Interest:STOCKSYMBOL__
account for each stock you own that pays dividends or interest.

====

[[invest-setup-example2]]

==== Example Stock Account

As an example, let&rsquo;s assume that you currently own 100 shares of
Amazon stock. First, create the stock account AMZN by selecting the
Stock account and click on the menu menu:ActionsNew Account...[]. The New
Account dialog will appear, follow the steps, in the sequence below to
setup your new stock account.

[[invest-newaccount]]
.New Account Window
image::figures/invest_newaccount.png["New Account Window",width=]


. __Account Name__ - Usually, use the stock
ticker abbreviation, IE: "AMZN"


. __Account Code__ - Optional field, use CUSIP,
the newspaper listing symbol, mutual fund family ID or code of your
own choosing.


. __Description__ - Optional field for detailed
description of the commodity/stock. Note this field by default is
displayed in the Account tab tree.


. __Account Type__ - Select the type of account
you are creating from the lower left-hand list.


. __Parent Account__ - Select the parent
account for the new account from the right hand listing. Expand list
of accounts if necessary.


. __Create the New Security__ - To use a new
stock, you must create the stock as a new commodity
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to first select Account Type __Stock__ or __Mutual Fund__ so that the
Select... button brings up the list of
securites rather than currencies.

====
+


** __Select Security/Currency__ - Click on
the Select ... button next to the
security/currency line. We must change the
security from the default (your default currency) to this
specific stock. This will bring up the
Select Security dialog.

** __Type__ - Select the exchange where the
security/commodity is traded (in this example NASDAQ).
+
Select the New button to open the
New Security window.
+
[[invest-selectsecurity]]
.Select Security Window
image::figures/invest_selectsecurity.png["Select Security Window",width=]

** __Create the Security__ - Click on the
New... button and enter the appropriate
information for this stock on the new form New Security.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<!--  Open inner most loop (#3)
-->
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    
+


** The Full name: is
"Amazon.com".

** The Symbol/abbreviation: is
"AMZN". The symbol is the stock ticker used in your
quote source several lines down on the form. Note that different
symbols will be utilized on different price sources for the same stock,
an example is Ericsson on the Stockholm Exchange is ERIC-B while
on Yahoo it is ERRICB.ST

** The Type: should already be
NASDAQ, because this is what was selected in the security selector, but you can change it here, including adding more categories. More information about this can be found in the Help Manual in section 7.7, "Security Editor".

** The ISIN, CUSIP or other code is where
you can enter some other coding number or text (leave it
blank in this example).

** The Fraction traded should be
adjusted to the smallest fraction of this security which can
be traded, usually 1/100 or 1/10000.

** The checkbox "Get Online Quotes", the
quote source and the timezone should be selected to define
the sources for updating prices on-line. See Also
<<invest-stockprice-auto2,
                    Setting Stock Price Automatically>>.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the Get Online Quotes button is not highlighted, and it
is not tickable, then the Finance::Quote package is not installed.
See the section on
<<invest-stockprice-auto-install3,
                    Installing Finance::Quote>>.

====
+
Below is what this window should look like when
finished: [[invest-newsecurity]]
.New Security Window
image::figures/invest_newsecurity.png["New Security Window",width=]



** __Save Security__ - Click on the
OK button to save this new security,
this will close the New Security window and
return to the New Account window.




++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<!--  Close inner most loop
-->
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    


. __Select the Security__ - you should now see
the newly created security available in the pull down menu for
Security/Currency. Select it (it is probably
already selected) and click on OK.


. __Smallest Fraction__ - Specify the smallest
fraction of the security/commodity that is traded.


. __Notes__ - Enter any notes or messages
related to this security/commodity.


. __Tax Related__ - Go to menu:Edit[Tax Report Options] to check this box if this
account&rsquo;s transactions will relate to Income Taxes.


. __Placeholder__ - Check box if this account
is a "Placeholder", that is it will contain no
transactions.


. __Finished__ - You should now have been
automatically returned to the New Account dialog, with the
symbol/abbreviation: line set to "AMZN
          (Amazon.com)". Click on OK to save
this new stock account.

You have now created the Amazon stock account, your main account
should look something like this (notice that there are a few extra
accounts here, a bank account, and an equity account):

[[invest-setup-current]]
.Setup Current Portfolio
image::figures/invest_setup_current.png["This image is after the creation of the first stock account (AMZN)",width=]

Open the account register window for this AMZN stock account
(double click on it). Here you see the **Commodity** view. This gives you an overview of
the transactions in this commodity including the number of units (shares for a stock or mutual fund) bought or sold, the net price per unit, and the total amount.
Obviously, we have not bought or sold any shares of AMZN yet, so the register should not contain any transactions.

[[invest-buy-stock1]]

=== Buying Shares

[[invest-buy-stock2]]

==== Entering Preexisting Shares


The examples in this section use Transaction Journal
         view.


To register the initial 100 shares of this stock that you purchased
previously, on the first (transaction) line, enter the date of the
purchase (eg: Jan. 1 2005) and Description (eg:
Opening Balance). On the first split line, enter 100 in Shares
        , delete the (unit) Price (it will be
calculated when you Tab out of the split) and enter
2000 in the Buy column.



[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to use GnuCash to
calculate Shares or Buy from
the other 2 columns but to avoid rounding errors, it is better to
automatically calculate Price.


====

Tab to the second split line, enter transfer from
account __Equity:Opening Balances__. For simplicity,
this example assumed there were no commissions on this transaction.
Your AMZN Commodity view should now appear like this:


[[invest-setup-portfolio1]]
.Setup Current Portfolio
image::figures/invest_setup_portfolio1.png["This image is of the transaction register of the AMZN account after the first stock purchase.",width=]

Notice that the Balance (last column) is in the
units of the commodity (AMZN shares) not in currency units. Thus, the
balance is 100 (AMZN units) rather than $2000. This is how it should be.


[[invest-buy-new2]]

==== Buying New Shares

The main difference between setting up a new stock purchase
versus the setup for preexisting stocks as described in the previous
section is that instead of transferring the money used to purchase the
stock from the __Equity:Opening Balances__ account, you
transfer from  your __Assets:Bank ABC__ or __Assets:Brokerage Account__ account.


[[invest-buy-com]]

===== Handling Commissions and Fees

For conciseness, this document will refer to the money you pay to
a broker for buying and selling securities as __Commissions__. Government fees may also be payable. Unless otherwise
stated, fees are handled in a similar way.



In GnuCash there are 2 alternate ways to
handle commissions (for simplicity this document section will refer to
these ways as net pricing and gross pricing):




** __Net Pricing:__ You enter a net
price (adjusted by commissions) when buying and selling
securities. You do __not__ also record commissions
in a specific commissions account in order to later claim it as an
expense, as this would be claiming commissions twice. This way
__is__ compatible with using
<<invest-sellLots>>. This results in a
slightly misleading price being added to the price database (the
effective price you paid) but is not usually of any concern.


OR



** __Gross Pricing:__ You enter the
price not adjusted by commissions and enter the commissions expense
on a separate split in the transaction. This enables the tracking of
commissions but is __not__ compatible with using
<<invest-sellLots>>. Scrubbing doesn't know to
deduct commissions and fees from the gains, so capital gains or
losses must be manually calculated (see
<<invest-sell-man>>).


Please get professional advice if you are unsure which of these
ways are applicable to your jurisdiction.


[[invest-buy-gross]]

===== Example: Buying Shares with Gross Pricing

In this example you will purchase $5000 of IBM stock, with a
commission of $100. First step will be to create the stock account for
IBM. The existing __Expenses:Commission__
account will be used. If you wish to track commissions to the
individual stock level an additional sub-account would be necessary.
E.g. __Expenses:Commission:IBM__.


Now for the transaction, on the first (transaction) line, enter
the Date of the purchase (eg: Jan. 3 2005) and
Description (eg: Initial IBM Purchase). On the
first split line, enter 50 in Shares, delete
Price (leave it empty so it will be calculated)),
and enter 5000 in Buy. You do not need to fill in
the Price column, as it will be calculated for
you when you Tab to the next split. The next line in
the split transaction will be __Expenses:Commissions__ and fill in Buy ($100). The third
line will be to transfer $5100 from account __Assets:Bank ABC__ to balance the transaction. Your IBM
Commodity view should now appear like this:


[[invest-setup-portfolio2]]
.Setup Current Portfolio
image::figures/invest_SetupPortfolio2.png["This image is of the transaction register of the IBM account after the first stock purchase with a commission.",width=]

[[invest-buy-net]]

===== Example: Buying Shares with Net Pricing

Repeating the previous example using Net Pricing instead of Gross
Pricing, in Transaction Journal view:


Purchase $5000 of IBM stock being 50 Shares for $100.00 each, plus
a commission of $100.

Now for the transaction, on the first (transaction) line, enter
the Date of the purchase (eg: Jan. 3 2005) and a
Description (eg: Initial IBM Purchase). On the
first split line, optionally enter more details in Memo
          , then 50 in Shares, delete
anything in Price (so it will be calculated by
dividing Buy by Shares when
you Tab out of the split), 5100 in Buy
           (50 * $100.00 + $100). Alternatively use
GnuCash to calculate Buy
by entering the formula __5000+100__ or __(50 * 100) + 100__ in Buy (
Buy will be calculated when you Tab
           out of the column. Use the Tab key as many
times as needed to proceed to the next split.



Do __not__ enter a separate split for Commission as
it has already been included in the Buy value.
The second split line will be to transfer from __Assets:Bank ABC__ $5100 to balance the transaction. After the
splits are all correct, use the Enter
           key to save the transaction. Your IBM Commodity view should
now appear like this:


[[invest-setup-portfolio3]]

[[invest-stockprice1]]

=== Setting Share Price

The value of a commodity, such as a stock, must be explicitly set.
The stock accounts track the quantity of stocks you own, but the value of
the stock is stored in the __Price Editor__. The values
set in the Price Editor can be updated manually or automatically.

[[invest-stockprice-initial2]]

==== Initial Price Editor Setup

To use the Price Editor to track a stock value, you must initially
insert the stock. To do so, open the Price Editor
(menu:Tools[Price Editor]) and
click on Add button. The first time a
Commodity/Stock is entered this window will be blank except for the
control buttons on the bottom. Select the appropriate Commodity you want
to insert into the Price Editor. At this point, you can input the price
of the commodity manually. There are 6 fields in the New Commodity
window:

Namespace:: The exchange market where the security/commodity
is traded (in this example NASDAQ)

Security:: The name of the commodity,
must be chosen from the Select... list

Currency:: The currency in which the
Price is expressed.

Date:: Date that the price is
valid

Type:: One of: Bid
(the market buying price), Ask (the market
selling price), Last (the last transaction
price), Net Asset Value (mutual fund price per
share), or Unknown. Stocks and currencies will
usually give their quotes as one of bid, ask or last. Mutual funds
are often given as net asset value. For other commodities, simply
choose Unknown. This option is for informational purposes only, it
is not used by GnuCash.

Price:: The price of one unit of this
commodity.

As an example of adding the AMZN commodity to the price editor,
with an initial value of $40.50 per share.

[[invest-peditor]]
.Price Editor
image::figures/invest_peditor.png["Adding the AMZN commodity to the price editor, with an initial value of $40.50 per share.",width=]

Click OK when finished. Once you have
performed this initial placement of the commodity into the Price Editor,
you will not have to do it again, even if you use the same commodity in
another account.


[NOTE]
====
If you have online retrieval of quotes activated (see <<invest-stockprice-auto2>>), you can initialize a
commodity without manually making an entry. When you initially add
the security in the Security Editor, check
Get Online Quotes and save the security.
Then, in the Price Editor, click
Get Quotes, and the new security will be
inserted into the price list with the retrieved price.

====

[[invest-stockprice-manual2]]

==== Setting Stock Price Manually

If the value of the commodity (stock) changes, you can adjust the
value by entering the Price Editor, selecting the commodity, clicking on
Edit and entering the new price.

[[invest-peditor2]]
.Price Editor
image::figures/invest_peditor2.png["The main price editor window, showing the list of all known commodities.",width=]

[[invest-stockprice-auto2]]

==== Configuring for Automatic Retrieval of Quotes

If you have more than a couple of commodities, you will tire of
having to update their prices constantly. GnuCash has the ability to
automatically download the most recent price for your commodities using
the Internet. This is accomplished through the Perl module
Finance::Quote, which must be installed in order to activate this
feature.

To determine if the Perl module Finance::Quote is already
installed on your system, type __perldoc Finance::Quote__ in
a terminal window and check to see if there is any documentation
available. If you see the documentation, then the module is installed,
if you do not see the documentation, then it has not been
installed.

[[invest-stockprice-auto-install3]]

===== Installing Finance::Quote

**Microsoft Windows:**

** Close GnuCash.

** Run **Install Online Price Retrieval** which can be found in the
GnuCash"Start" menu
entry.




**Mac OS X:** You need to
have XCode installed. XCode is an optional item from your OS X
distribution DVD. Run the **Update Finance Quote** app in the
GnuCash dmg. You can run it from the
dmg or copy it to the same folder to which you copied
GnuCash. It will open a Terminal
window and run a script for you which will ask lots of
questions. Accept the default for each unless you know what
you&rsquo;re doing.

**Linux:**

** Close any running GnuCash instances.

** Locate the folder where GnuCash
is installed by searching for gnc-fq-update

** Change to that directory, open a root shell

** Run the command __gnc-fq-update__



This will launch a Perl CPAN update session that will go out
onto the internet and install the Finance::Quote module on
your system. The gnc-fq-update program is interactive,
however, with most systems you should be able to answer
"no" to the first question: "Are you ready
	for manual configuration? [yes]" and the update will
continue automatically from that point.

After installation is complete, you should run the "gnc-fq-dump"
test program, in the same directory, distributed with GnuCash to test
if Finance::Quote is installed and working properly.


[NOTE]
====
If you feel uncomfortable about performing any of these steps,
please either email the GnuCash-user mailing list
(pass:[<email>gnucash-user@gnucash.org</email>]) for help or come to the GnuCash IRC
channel on irc.gnome.org. You can also leave out this step and
manually update your stock prices.

====

[[invest-stockprice-auto-configure3]]

===== Configuring Securities for Online Quotes

With Finance::Quote installed and functioning correctly, you
must configure your GnuCash securities to use this feature to
obtain updated price information automatically. Whether creating new securities or modifying securities
that have already been setup, use the menu:Tools[Security Editor], to edit the
security and check the Get Online Quotes box. You will
now be able to modify the radio buttons for Type of quote source, the pull-down menus
to specify the specific source(s) and The timezone for these
        quotes. When finished editing, Close the Security Editor to return to
the Price Editor and click on the Get Quotes
button to update your stock prices on the Internet.

The command __gnucash --add-price-quotes $HOME/gnucash-filename__
can be used to fetch the current prices of your stocks.  The file specified
__$HOME/gnucash-filename__ will depend on the name and location of your
data file.
This can be determined by the name displayed in the top frame of the GnuCash window,
before the "-".  The file name can also be found under 
in the recently opened file list; the first item, numbered 1, is the name of the currently
open file.

This can be automated by creating a crontab entry. For example,
to update your file every Friday evening (16:00) after the relevant exchange
markets close (modify the time accordingly for your time zone), you could add
the following to your personal crontab:

0 16 * * 5 gnucash --add-price-quotes $HOME/gnucash-filename &gt;
/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

Remember that Mutual Fund "prices" are really "Net Asset
        Value" and require several hours after the exchange closes before being
available. If NAVs are downloaded before the current days NAVs are
determined, yesterday&rsquo;s NAVs are retrieved.

[[invest-stockprice-view2]]

==== Displaying Share Value

The main account window, by default, only shows the quantity of
each commodity that you own, under the column heading
Total. In the case of stocks, this commodity is the
number of shares. Often, however, you will want to see the value of your
stocks expressed in terms of some monetary unit. This is easily
accomplished by entering the main window, selecting the Accounts tab,
by clicking on the __Titlebar__Options button (the small
down pointing arrow on the right side of the main account window titles bar), and
selecting the option to display the account total field "Total
      (USD)". You will see a new column in the main window entitled
Total (USD) that will express the value of all
commodities in the report currency.

[[invest-stockvalue]]

image::figures/invest_stockvalue.png["Viewing the value of a stock commodity in the main window using the Total in Report Currency option.",width=]

[[invest-stockprice-report]]

==== Selecting "Price Source" in Stock Value Reports

Most GnuCash Asset reports have options to set/modify a number of parameters for the report.  The
Options windows is displayed by selecting the report tab then clicking on either the Options
icon in the __Menubar__ or selecting menu:Edit[Report Options].
The General tab in the
resulting window contains various parameters for the report.  One of these is "Price Source" which of offers
three alternatives to determine stock prices in reports:


[NOTE]
====
In the example below, the report is a customization of
the **Average Balance** report
in the Assets &amp; Liabilities reports submenu.

[[invest-stockvalue-report-options]]
.Determining Stock Price Source in Reports
image::figures/invest_stockvalue_report_options.png["Determining the value of a stock commodity in a report by setting the Price Source option.",width=]



** Weighted Average - gives you a graph of
the weighted price of all __transactions__. It will
__not__ take into account prices defined in the
price editor.

** Most recent - displays the changing value
of your stocks based solely on __the most recent__
price available from the price editor. The price figuring in your
stock transactions is __not__ considered.

** Nearest in time - the graph is
exclusively based on the prices available from the price editor. The
value of your stock at each step and point in time is calculated
based on the nearest available price in the price editor.

[[invest-sell1]]

=== Selling Shares

Entering an investment sale transaction is done in a similar way to
entering a buy transaction (see <<invest-buy-new2>>) except
the amount entered in the __Shares__ column is negative
and the proceeds of the transaction is entered in the __Sell__ column. The net proceeds from the sale should be
transferred from the shares account to your bank or brokerage account.


For information on handling __commissions__ and the
use of __Net Pricing__ or __Gross Pricing__,
please see <<invest-buy-com>>.


If you will be recording a capital gain or loss on the sale, please
see <<chapter_capgain>> and <<chapter_dep>>
for more information on this topic.


To use the GnuCash__Automatic Calculation of Capital Gain or Loss Using Lots__ feature, please
see <<invest-sellLots>> otherwise continue to the next
section.


[[invest-sell-man]]

==== Selling Shares with Manual Calculation of Capital Gain or Loss 


[NOTE]
====
In order for GnuCash to commit the
zero-share, zero-price split for account __Assets:Stock:SYMBOL__ to the transaction in the following schemes, you *must*
Tab out of that split. If you use the
Enter key, GnuCash
           will convert the split into shares of the commodity.


====

In the schemes of transaction splits presented below, the
following symbols are used:




** NUM_SHARES: number of shares you are selling

** COMMISSION: brokerage commissions or fees

** GROSS_SELL_PRICE: unit price for which you sold the
shares, not reduced by COMMISSION

** NET_SELL_PRICE: unit price for which you sold the shares,
reduced by COMMISSION

** GROSS_BUY_PRICE: unit price for which you bought the shares,
not increased by COMMISSION

** NET_BUY_PRICE: unit price for which you bought the shares,
increased by COMMISSION

** GROSS_BUY: total price for which you bought shares,
excluding COMMISSION, equal to NUM_SHARES * GROSS_BUY_PRICE

** NET_BUY: amount of money for which you bought shares
including COMMISSION, equal to GROSS_BUY + COMMISSION.

** GROSS_SALE: total price for which you sold shares,
equal to NUM_SHARES * GROSS_SELL_PRICE

** NET_SALE: amount of money received from the sale, equal to
GROSS_SALE − COMMISSION

** GROSS_PROFIT: amount of money you made on the sale, not
reduced by COMMISSION

** NET_PROFIT: amount of money you made on the sale, reduced by
COMMISSION


There are 2 ways of manually recording the capital gain or loss.
The capital gain/loss can be combined with the sale in one transaction
or it can be entered in a separate transaction.


[[invest-sell-man-comb]]

===== Combine the Sale and Capital Gain/Loss in One Transaction

This has the advantage that all parts of the sale event are kept
together. This is __not__ compatible with using
__scrubbing__
(see <<invest-sellLots>>). If you may in future use
scrubbing on a specific security, save some work later by entering the
capital gain/loss splits in a separate transaction now.


When the capital gain/loss splits are combined with the sale
splits in one transaction, there are 2 splits for the security
account in the same transaction, so the transaction must be entered
with the security register in  Auto-Split Ledger
or Transaction Journal view. One of the splits
for the security account is for the sale and the other is for the
capital gain or loss. The security account split for the capital gain
or loss must be entered with 0 number of shares and 0 price per share
to stop the automatic recalculation of these fields.



Account for the profit or loss as coming from an
__Income:Capital Gains__ or
__Expenses:Capital Loss__ account.

[[invest-sellLots]]

==== Selling Shares with Automatic Calculation of Capital Gain or Loss Using Lots

[[invest-sellLotsIntro]]

===== Introduction

link:$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot$$[Wikipedia]
includes the following definition of a lot


"a set of goods for sale together in an auction; or a
          quantity of a financial instrument".


GnuCash has a built-in lot management
facility that can be used to keep track of capital gains or losses
resulting from security sales. Buy and sell transactions are put into
lots for the purpose of calculating the cost of the sale. More
specifically, a lot is used to link particular buy and sell
transaction splits. Lots can be automatically or manually created and
linked. Capital gain or loss can be automatically calculated and
transaction(s) created for the difference between the sale value and
the cost of the securities sold. GnuCash
refers to this process as __scrubbing__.


The term __scrub__ is used because security
accounts need to be cleaned after sales to ensure the difference
between the cost paid for securities, and value received from selling
them, is accounted for as capital gain or loss. If the capital
gain/loss is not correct, the Trial Balance
(menu:Reports[Income &amp; Expense &gt; Trial Balance]) bottom line total debits will not balance to
total credits.



[NOTE]
====
If you make an error, you can delete the lot(s) and capital
gain/loss transaction(s) and retry. Ensure you delete the lot, or at
least unlink sale transactions from the lot, before you delete a
capital gain/loss transaction. Otherwise, the Lots in
          Account screen will recreate the capital gain/loss
transaction when you select the lot.

====


If you are not familiar with FIFO, LIFO or Average costing, please see
Wikipedia link:$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_and_LIFO_accounting$$[ FIFO and LIFO accounting] and link:$$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_cost_method$$[ Average cost method].



If you are not familiar with the difference between GnuCash
           transactions and splits, please see
<<txns-registers-txntypes>>.



The GnuCash lot management facility can be a
useful feature, reducing manual calculation, especially if dividends
have been reinvested over years and there are many different costs
involved. It can automatically link buy transactions to sell
transactions using FIFO cost method and one can manually link specific
buy transactions to sell transactions in order to use LIFO.
Advanced Portfolio Report basis costs and gains/losses will agree with
the costs and gain/loss transactions created by scrubbing if either
the FIFO or LIFO cost methods are used.


[[invest-sellLotsWin]]

===== Lots in Account Window


The Lots in Account SSSS window, where SSSS is
a security account, is used to manually or automatically link

[[invest-sellProcedure]]

===== Procedure Summary

Using the lot management facility for the automatic calculation of
capital gain or loss typically follows these steps:



. Record the sale transaction using Net Pricing (but stop short
of entering the Capital Gain transaction as it will be created by
scrubbing). See <<invest-sell-man-prof-sep-net>>.



. <<invest-sellManual>>  (Optional
depending on cost method)

[[invest-sellManual]]

===== Manual Lot Creation and Linking

Before using this feature, ensure you have read
<<invest-sellConsiderations>>.


This functionality allows the manual linking of specfic buy and
sell transactions. It may be used in the case where a user wishes to
use a different cost method than the automatic linking method (FIFO).
Effectively, if one wishes the cost basis and capital gains in the
Advanced Portfolio Report to be consistent with the capital gains
transactions created by scrubbing, manual lot creation only needs to
be used when using LIFO or "sale of designated lots"
(the same thing for securities as far as US personal tax law is
concerned). This is because the scrub function can automatically do
FIFO linking so there is no need to do it manually and scrubbing
cannot be used for average costing.


See <<invest-sellManualExample>>.


[[invest-sellAuto]]

===== Automatic Creation of Capital Gain Or Loss Transactions


[NOTE]
====
Do __NOT__ do this unless you are using
FIFO or LIFO to cost sales. See
<<invest-sellConsiderations>>

====

GnuCash can automatically calculate and
create security sale capital gain/loss transactions. Lots are used to
link buy transaction splits with sell transaction splits so the
correct cost of the securities sold can be determined.
GnuCash will use any existing lots, and
create new lots for any buy transaction splits not already linked to a
lot. Buy and sell transaction splits are linked to lots using FIFO
method.


See:

<<invest-sellAutoExample>>

<<invest-sellAutoExample2>>

<<invest-sellFifoSplit>>

[[invest-sellChgCapGainsAcct]]

===== Change Orphaned Gains-CCC to Gain/Loss Account


The capital gain/loss transaction(s) created by scrubbing uses an
automatically created generic __Orphaned Gains-CCC__
account (where CCC is the security currency) because 
          GnuCash doesn't know which capital gain or loss account
should be used. After scrubbing, the user should edit the __Orphaned Gains-CCC__ transaction split to re-assign the
income account to a more meaningful income (or expense) gain or loss
account (e.g. __Income:Long Term Capital Gain:IBM__).


See <<invest-sellChgCapGainsAcctExample>>.


[[invest-sellTrialBal]]

===== Run a Trial Balance

Running a Trial Balance report
(menu:Reports[Income &amp; Expense &gt; Trial Balance]) after creating capital gain/loss
transactions, is a basic check that capital gains/losses are
correctly accounting for the difference between the cost paid for
securities, and value received from selling them. At the end of the
report, total debits should equal total credits.



[TIP]
====
A Trial Balance may not balance due to some other problem. To
determine if the cause of an imbalance is from incorrectly
accounting for capital gain/loss:


If necessary, temporarily change the date of the sell
transaction and the capital gain/loss transaction, so they are
the only transactions for a particular date, then run the Trial
Balance as at the day before. If the Trial Balance is still out
by the same amount, it is not the capital gain/loss that is
causing the problem.


If you find a prior __out of balance__ Trial Balance, keep running the Trial Balance
report with different dates until you find the date it starts
being out of balance. Temporarily change the transaction dates
for each transaction on the problem date to the following
day, then change the dates back to the correct date 1 at a time,
running the Trial Balance each time, until you identify the
problem transaction. When you change the date of a security
sell transaction, you also need to change the date of the
corresponding capital gain transaction as it is only the
sum of these that will balance in the Trial Balance.


====

[[invest-sellConsiderations]]

===== Considerations

There are some points that should be considered before using the
lot management facility.



. GnuCash implements only the First In/
First Out (FIFO) cost method when automatically linking buy
transactions to sell transactions. I.e. The oldest securities are
always sold first. The Last In First Out (LIFO) cost method may be
used by manually linking the most recent buy security splits to
the sell split before scrubbing.



. The Advanced Portfolio Report does not use lot information
when calculating costs, just the security transaction splits. It
calculates the cost basis and gains or losses using the selected
__Basis calculation method__ report option
(Average, FIFO or LIFO). If one wishes the Advanced Portfolio
Report costs and gains/losses to be consistent with the capital
gain/loss transactions created by scrubbing, the same cost model
must be used in both places.



. 
Scrubbing does not recognize commissions or fees so makes no
allowance for them in the calculation of gain or loss. Therefore
you must use __Net Pricing__ rather than
__Gross Pricing__ if you wish to use scrubbing.
See <<invest-buy-com>>.



. Scrubbing does not recognize capital gain/loss transaction
splits if they have been manually entered as part of the sale
transaction. Therefore ensure previous sales are recorded as 2
transactions:

+
.Transaction 1 dealing with value received and the reduction of the number of shares 

|===============
|__Account__|__Tot Shares__|__(Unit) Price__|__Buy (Debit)__|__Sell (Credit)__
|Brokerage or Bank|||Debit|
|Security|−NumSold|SaleUnitPrice||SaleValue

|===============
+
.Transaction 2 capital gain/loss (loss in this example) 

|===============
|__Account__|__Tot Shares__|__(Unit) Price__|__Buy (Debit)__|__Sell (Credit)__
|Capital Loss|||Debit|
|Security|0|0||Credit

|===============

. The automatic capital gains calculations can handle
straightforward buy, sell, and return of capital transactions but
any transaction that affect the number of shares, even simple
splits, will cause it to produce wrong answers so those cases must
be handled manually.


[[invest-sellManualExample]]

===== Example 1: Manual Lot Creation and Linking

Here is an example of selling part of a security holding using
the LIFO method. In this example, the most recent buy transaction
(dated 01/07/2016, a reinvested dividend), is linked to a lot, along
with the sell transaction, and the GnuCash
scrub function is used to calculate capital gain or loss and create
the capital gain/loss transaction.



. Open the security account's register.
+
[[invest-lots0reg]]
.Example of security register before lot scrubbing 
image::figures/investLots0_RegB4Scrub.png["An image of the Security Account register in transaction journal view, before lot scrubbing.",width=]


. Ensure all previous capital gain/loss transactions
are separate transactions to the sell transactions which record the
reduction in the number of shares and the value received.


. Select
menu:Actions[View Lots] to open the Lots in Account SSSS
window where SSSS is the security account.

+
[[invest-lots1B4CreateLot]]
.Example of Lots in Account window before lot scrubbing 
image::figures/investLots1_BeforeCreateLot.png["An image of the Lots in Account window before lot scrubbing.",width=]


. Create a new lot using the  button.
Initially this lot is not linked to any buy or sell split.


. Highlight the new lot in the Lots in This
            Account panel.


. Highlight the buy split (dated 01/07/2016) of the
security to be sold in the Splits free panel.



. Click the  &gt;&gt;  button to link the buy
split with the highlighted lot. The split moves from the 
            Splits free panel to the Splits in Lot
             panel.


. Repeat the previous 2 steps for any other buy splits
that should be included in the lot (in this example, there is only
1 buy split in the sale).


. Highlight the sell split in the Splits free
               panel.


. Click the  &gt;&gt;  button to link the sell
split with the highlighted lot.


. Check the lot Balance is as expected.
I.e. in this example the lot balance should be zero as the number
of securities sold in the lot, is matched with the same number of
security buys.

[[invest-sellAutoExample]]

===== Example 2: Automatic Creation of Capital Gain Or Loss Transactions

Create the capital gains transaction by following these steps:



. Open the security account's register.


. Ensure any previous manually entered capital gain/loss
transaction splits have been entered in separate transactions to the
the sell transactions.


. Select menu:Actions[View Lots] to open the
Lots in Account SSSS window where SSSS is the
security account.


. If using LIFO, use the above procedure
<<invest-sellManual>> to create a lot for each sell
transaction, link the lot with the sell transaction and each of
the buy transactions that make up the sale.


. Click the Scrub Account button which:

+


** Creates lots for any buy transactions that are not already
linked to a lot and links them to sell transactions splits
using the FIFO method. As a transaction split can only
be linked to 1 lot, if a sell transaction needs to be linked
to multiple lots, the sell transaction split is itself split
into multiple subsplits. In the case of multiple subsplits,
it is possible to have different splits from the same
transaction in both the Splits free and
Splits in lot panels.


** Creates a separate transaction per lot for
capital gain/loss.



. Continue to
<<invest-sellChgCapGainsAcct>>

[[invest-sellAutoExample2]]

===== Example 3: Automatic Creation of Capital Gain Or Loss Transactions, 2 Sales at Once

Here is an example of FIFO scrubbing without manual lot creation.
In this example, the transactions for 2 sales are scrubbed at once
but usually scrubbing would be performed after each sale. One reason
for scrubbing 2 sales at once, could be because there were multiple
sales on the same day.

===== Example 4: Automatic Creation of Capital Gain Or Loss Transactions - After a Simple Stock Split

Here is an example of FIFO scrubbing without manual lot
creation/linking, where the Stock Split Assistant has been used for a
simple stock split. In this example, 100 shares of security XYZ were
bought for $10.00 each, there was a simple 2 for 1 stock split for
zero cost (so the holding was then 200 shares @ $5.00 each), then all
200 shares were sold for $6.00 each.


[[investLotsSplitReg]]

[[investLotsSplitLot1]]
.Example of security register after Scrub Account is used. 
image::figures/investLotsSplitLot1.png["An image of the Security Account register in transaction journal view, after Scrub Account is used.",width=]

The above screen shots show that scrubbing created:

2 lots. A separate lot for each buy (it essentially treats the
stock split as a buy of 100 for no cost)


2 capital gain transactions (one for each lot) on the date of the
sale:




** 
Lot 0: 1/7/2009 loss $400 (sale $600 − cost $1000)

** 
Lot 1: 1/7/2009 gain $600 (sale $600 − cost $0)


Total gain $200 is correct. Whether the gain is a single long-term
one or one each of long-term and short-term or whether there's even a
distinction depends on the user's tax jurisdiction and the way the
split is structured. If the user needs help figuring it out they
should consult a professional.


[[invest-sellChgCapGainsAcctExample]]

=====  Example 5: Changing the Orphaned Gains-CCC to Gain/Loss Account 


. Close the Lots in Account SSSS window if
open and return to the security account register.

+
[[invest-lots4AftScrub1LotReg]]
.Example of security register after scrubbing a single lot 
image::figures/investLots2_RegAfterScrub1Lot.png["An image of the security register after scrubbing a single lot.",width=]


. Find each new __Realized Gain/Loss__
transaction in the security account register (they will
have the same date as the sell transactions). Edit the __Orphaned Gains-CCC__ transaction split to re-assign the
income account to a more meaningful income (or expense) gain or
loss account (e.g. __Income:Long Term Capital Gain:IBM__).

+
[TIP]
====
You may like to split the capital gain/loss into
taxable and non taxable parts if that is in accord with your
tax laws.

[[invest-dividends1]]

=== Dividends

Some companies or mutual funds pay periodic dividends to
shareholders. Dividends are typically given in one of two ways, either
they are automatically reinvested into the commodity or they are given as
cash. Mutual funds are often setup to automatically reinvest the dividend,
while common stock dividends usually pay cash.

[[invest-dividendcash]]

==== Dividends in Cash

If the dividend is presented as cash, you should record the
transaction in the asset account that received the money, as income
from __Income:Dividends__. Additionally if you want to tie
the cash dividend to a particular stock holding then add a dummy
transaction split to the stock account with quantity 0 price 1 value 0.

As an example consider the following; the dividends
deposited as cash into the __Broker__ Account with a tie
to the stock account.

[[invest-dividendcash1]]
.Example of cash dividend transactions
image::figures/invest_dividendcash.png["An image of the Brokerage Account register after a series of cash dividends.",width=]


[NOTE]
====
If you want to track dividends on a per-stock basis, you would
need to create an __Income:Dividends:STOCKSYMBOL__ account for each stock
you own that pays dividends.

====

[[invest-dividendreinvest]]

==== Dividends Re-Invested

If you receive the dividend in the form of an automatic
reinvestment, the transaction for this should be handled within
the stock or mutual fund account as income from "Income:Dividend" for the
appropriate number of reinvested shares. This type of reinvest account is often referred
to as a DRIP (Dividend Re-Investment Program).

As an example consider the following purchase of NSTAR (NST) stock with the
dividends reinvested into a DRIP Account. Mutual fund re-investments would be the same.


Starting with the purchase of 100 shares on Jan. 3, 2005, all dividends will be
reinvested and an account is created to track the dividend to the specific stock. GnuCash
simplifies the entry by allowing calculations within the cells of the transaction. If the
first dividend is $.29/share, enter $53.28 (purchase price + dividend) in the share Price
cell and 100*.29 in the Buy cell. GnuCash will calculate for you the
corresponding numer of Shares

[[invest-dividendreinvest1]]
.Example of dividend reinvestment transactions
image::figures/invest_dividendreinvest1.png["An image of the NST Stock Account register after a dividend reinvestment.",width=]

[[invest-retofcap]]

=== Return of Capital

This refers to a transaction where an investment returns capital to
the investor and doesn't have any accounting implications other than
reducing the cost basis. The number of shares held is not changed.


A Return of Capital transaction can be entered in the stock register
by entering the stock split with



|===============
|Shares|0
|Price|0
|Sell|Return of Capital value

|===============


The other side of the double entry would usually be a debit to the
brokerage bank account.


[[invest-ret-of-cap]]
.Example of return of capital transactions
image::figures/invest_ret_of_cap.png["An image of the Stock Account register after a return of capital.",width=]


[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to use the Stock Split Assistant to do this
type of transaction.

====


[TIP]
====
If you accidentally entered a non-zero price in the stock split,
GnuCash may have created an unwanted price database
entry which could cause reports to be wrong. Check for and remove such an
unwanted entry from the price database using menu:Tools
    [Price Editor].

====

[[invest-splitsnmergers1]]

=== Splits and Mergers

Companies may split their stock for many reasons but the most common
is that the price has risen higher than management thinks is a reasonable price for
many investors. Some of these splits are simple exchanges (eg 2 for 1 or 3 for 2)
and some are complex exchanges with cash distributions.  Splits may also result in
fewer shares if the exchange rate is a reverse split (1 for 3 or .75 for 1).


[[invest-simplesplit]]

==== Simple Stock Split

As an example, our holding of NST stock declared a 2 for 1 stock split effective
June 6, 2005.  The process for entering this transaction is; select
menu:Actions[Stock Split] to start
the assistant.

[[invest-split1]]
.An image of the stock split assistant at step 1. 
image::figures/invest_split1.png["An image of the selection of the stock split assistant.",width=]

The first screen is an Introduction, select Forward to
display the selection of the account and stock for the split.  You will need to
create an entry for each __Account:Stock__ combination you hold.

[[invest-split2]]
.An image of the stock split assistant at step 2 - Selection of Account/Stock. 
image::figures/invest_split2.png["An image of the stock split assistant at step 2 - Selection of Account/Stock.",width=]

Select the __Assets:Investments:DRIPs:NST__ and click on
Forward.

The next screen presents 5 fields in the Stock Splits Details window:



** Date - Enter the date of the split.

** Shares -  The number of shares increased (or decreased)
in the transaction.
+
In our example it is a 2 for 1 split so the number of additional shares
is the number of shares currently in the register.

** Description - The Description should give a brief
explanation of the transaction.

** New Price - If desired the new price of the stock,
after the split, may be entered.

** Currency - The currency of the transaction
is required.  This should be the same as the stock purchase currency.

[[invest-merger1]]

==== Moderately Complex Stock Merger

As an example, assume you held AT&amp;T stock during the Nov. 18, 2005 merger of SBC
with AT&amp;T. For this example you will have purchased AT&amp;T on April 1, 2005, any
dividends will have been paid in cash, therefore not entered into the AT&amp;T
stock register. 

 The conditions of the merger were .77942 share of SBC stock were exchanged for
each share of AT&amp;T stock.  The merged company continued to use the symbol
"T" from AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T paid a "dividend" of $1.20/share on the transaction date,
however this will not appear in the stock account as it was a cash distribution.

The process for entering this transaction is identical to the simple split until
the "Details" screen.  You will need to create an split entry in each
__Investment Account:Stock__ account combination that has shares
splitting.

[[invest-merge2]]
.An image of the stock split assistant at step 2. 
image::figures/invest_merge2.png["An image of the stock split assistant at step 2 - Selection of Account/Stock (Investment Account:T).",width=]

Select the __Assets:Investments:Brokerage Account:Stock:T__ and click on
Forward.

The next screen presents 5 fields in the Stock Splits Details window:



** Date - Enter the date of the split.  Here we&rsquo;ll enter
November 18, 2005.

** Shares -  The number of shares increased (or decreased)
in the transaction.
+
In our example it is a .77942 for 1 split so the number of shares will
decrease from the number of shares currently in the register.  You may use GnuCash&rsquo;s
ability to perform calculations on an entry form by entering data directly
(E.g. "(.77942*100)−100") to calculate the decrease in shares
from the split.

** Description - The Description should give a brief
explanation of the transaction.

** New Price - If desired the new price of the stock,
after the split, may be entered.

** Currency - The currency of the transaction
is required.  This should be the same as the stock purchase currency.
