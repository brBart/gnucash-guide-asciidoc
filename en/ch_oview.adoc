[[oview-featuresaccounting2]]

==== Accounting Features

For those knowledgeable in accounting, here is a list of GnuCash&rsquo;s
accounting features.



** __Double Entry__: Every transaction must
debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures
the "books balance" - that the difference between income and expense
exactly equals the sum of all bank, cash, stock and other
assets.

** __Split Transactions__: A single transaction
can be split into several pieces to record taxes, fees, and other
compound entries.

** __Chart of Accounts__: A master account can
have a hierarchy of detail accounts underneath it. This allows
similar account types such as Cash, Bank, or Stock to be grouped
into a master account such as "Assets".

** __General Journal__: One register window can
display multiple accounts at the same time. This eases the trouble
of tracking down typing/entry errors. It also provides a convenient
way of viewing a portfolio of many stocks, by showing all
transactions in that portfolio.

** __Income/Expense Account Types (Categories)__: These categorize your cash flow and, when
used properly with the double-entry feature, will provide an
accurate Profit&amp;Loss statement.

=== About this Book

This manual&rsquo;s goal is to save you time. It will get you started
using GnuCash as quickly as possible.

Each chapter follows a simple format. A chapter begins with a
"Concepts" discussion which introduces general themes and
terminology, addressed and used within that chapter. "How-To"

detailed, concrete examples.

Beginning users will find the "Concepts" sections very
helpful. They provide a reference for good ways to track your finances,
