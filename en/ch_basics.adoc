== The Basics

This chapter will introduce some of the basics of using GnuCash. It is
recommended that you read through this chapter, before starting to do any
real work with GnuCash. Next chapters will begin to show
you hands on examples.

[[basics-accounting1]]

=== Accounting Concepts

GnuCash is easy enough to use that you do not need to have a
complete understanding of accounting principles to find it useful.
However, you will find that some basic accounting knowledge will prove to
be invaluable as GnuCash was designed using these principles as a
template. It is highly recommended that you understand this section of the
guide before proceeding.

[[basics-accounting52]]

==== The 5 Basic Accounts

Basic accounting rules group all finance related things into 5
fundamental types of "accounts". That is, everything that
accounting deals with can be placed into one of these 5 accounts:

__Assets__:: Things you own

__Liabilities__:: Things you owe

__Equity__:: Overall net worth

__Income__:: Increases the value of your
accounts

__Expenses__:: Decreases the value of your
accounts

It is clear that it is possible to categorize your financial world
into these 5 groups. For example, the cash in your bank account is an
asset, your mortgage is a liability, your paycheck is income, and the
cost of dinner last night is an expense.

[[basics-accountingequation2]]

==== The Accounting Equation

With the 5 basic accounts defined, what is the relationship
between them? How does one type of account affect the others? Firstly,
equity is defined by assets and liability. That is, your net worth is
calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets:

__Assets - Liabilities = Equity__

Furthermore, you can increase your equity through income, and
decrease equity through expenses. This makes sense of course, when you
receive a paycheck you become "richer" and when you pay for dinner you
become "poorer". This is expressed mathematically in what is known as
the Accounting Equation:

__Assets - Liabilities = Equity + (Income - Expenses)__

This equation must always be balanced, a condition that can only
be satisfied if you enter values to multiple accounts. For example: if
you receive money in the form of income you must see an equal increase
in your assets. As another example, you could have an increase in assets
if you have a parallel increase in liabilities.

[[basics-AccountRelationships]]
.The basic accounts relationships
image::figures/basics_AccountRelationships.svg["A graphical view of the relationship between the 5 basic accounts. Net worth (equity) increases through income and decreases through expenses. The arrows represent the movement of value.",width=]

[[basics-accountingdouble2]]

==== Double Entry

The accounting equation is the very heart of a double entry
      accounting system. For every change in value of one account in the
Accounting Equation, there must be a balancing change in another. This
concept is known as the Principle of Balance, and
is of fundamental importance for understanding GnuCash and other double
entry accounting systems. When you work with GnuCash, you will always be
concerned with at least 2 accounts, to keep the accounting equation
balanced.

Balancing changes (or transfers of money) among accounts are
done by debiting one account and simultaneously crediting another.
Accounting debits and
credits do not mean "decrease"
and "increase". Debits and credits each increase certain
types of accounts and decrease others. In asset and expense accounts,
debits increase the balance and credits decrease the balance. In
liability, equity and income accounts, credits increase the balance
and debits decrease the balance.

In traditional double-entry accounting, the left column in the
register is used for debits, while the right column is used for credits.
Accountants record increases in asset and expense accounts on the
debit (left) side, and they record increases in liability, revenue, and equity
accounts on the credit (right) side. GnuCash
follows this convention in the register.


[NOTE]
====
This accounting terminology can be confusing to new users,
which is why GnuCash allows you to use the
common terms Deposit and
Withdrawal. If you prefer the formal accounting
terms, you can change the account register column headings to use
them in the Accounts tab under
Preferences (see the
GnuCash Help Manual for more information on
setting preferences).

====


[WARNING]
====
Common use of the words __debit__ and __credit__
does not match how accountants use these words. In common use,
__credit__ generally has positive associations; in accounting,
__credit__ means
__affecting the right column__ of the ledger sheet of an account.
This is associated with a __decrease__ in asset and expense,
but an __increase__ of income, liability and equity accounts.

For more details see link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits$$[].

====

[[basics-entry1]]

=== Data Entry Concepts

When entering data in GnuCash, you should be aware of the 3 levels
of organization in which GnuCash divides your data: files, accounts and
transactions. These levels are presented in their order of complexity, one
file contains many accounts and one account contains many transactions.
This division is fundamental to understanding how to use GnuCash.

[[basics-files2]]

==== Files

GnuCash stores information at the
highest level in files. A file can be stored on your computer either
as a single XML file (in all versions of
GnuCash), or in a SQL
database (in GnuCash version 2.4 and higher).


[NOTE]
====
SQL is pronounced "sequel",
so in spoken and written language we would say "a SQL
        database".

====

With the XML file format,
GnuCash stores your data in an
XML data file, usually in compressed format
(although this can be changed in the General
tab of the GnuCashPreferences).

With SQL storage,
GnuCash stores your data in a
SQL database under the database application you
select (SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL).

You will need one main file or database for each set of
accounts you are maintaining. To learn how to create and manage
GnuCash files, see <<basics-files1>>.


[NOTE]
====
If you think you might need more than one set of accounts,
you might want to consult a professional accountant or bookkeeper
before proceeding. Most users will probably have only one data
file.

====

Backup files and log files are automatically generated by
GnuCash when appropriate. Backup and log
files are described in <<basics-backup1>>.

[[basics-accounts2]]

==== Accounts

An account keeps track of what you own,
owe, spend or receive. Each GnuCash file can
contain any number of accounts, and each account can contain many
sub-accounts up to an arbitrary number of levels. This simple feature
gives GnuCash much of its power in managing
your finances, as you will see in later chapters.

Examples of accounts include: checking accounts, savings
accounts, credit card accounts, mortgages, and loans. Each
GnuCash account tracks the activity for that
"real" account, and can inform you of its status.

In addition, accounts are also used to categorize the money you
receive or spend. For example, you can create expense accounts to
track the money you pay on utilities or groceries. Even though these
are not accounts that receive statements, they allow you to determine
how much money is being spent in each of these areas.

Accounts will be covered in more detail in <<chapter_accts>>.

[[basics-transactions2]]

==== Transactions

A transaction represents the movement of
money among accounts. Whenever you spend or receive money, or
transfer money between accounts, that is a transaction.

Examples of transactions are: paying a phone bill, transferring
money from savings to checking, buying a pizza, withdrawing money,
and depositing a paycheck. <<chapter_txns>> goes more
in depth on how to enter transactions.

In <<basics-accountingdouble2,double entry accounting>>,
transactions always involve at least two accountsâ€“a source
account and a destination account.
GnuCash manages this by inserting a line
into the transaction for every account that is affected, and
recording the amounts involved in each line. A line within a
transaction that records the account and amount of money involved is
called a split. A transaction can contain an
arbitrary number of splits.


[NOTE]
====
Splits in transactions will be covered in <<txns-registers-multiaccount2>>

====

[[basics-interface1]]

=== Interface

The very first time you open GnuCash, you will see the
Welcome to GnuCash! screen. From there, GnuCash
provides other tools to help you easily find what you are looking for.
Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the common screens and screen boxes you will
see.

[[basics-tip2]]

==== Tip of the Day

GnuCash provides a Tip of the Day screen to
give helpful hints for using the program:

[[basics-TipOfDay]]
.The Tip of the Day
image::figures/basics_TipOfDay.png["This image shows the Tip of the Day.",width=]

These tips provide useful information for beginning users. To view
more of the tips, click Forward to continue. If you
do not wish to see this screen box on start-up, deselect the box next to
Show tips at startup. When you have
finished viewing the helpful tips, click Close to
close the Tip of the Day screen.

[[basics-main2]]

==== Account Tree Window

You should now see the Accounts window, which
appears as shown below. The exact layout of the account tree will depend
on which default accounts you selected during the New Account Hierarchy
Setup. In this example, the Common Accounts are shown.

[[basics-Accounts]]
.The Account Tree Window
image::figures/basics_Accounts.png["This image shows the Accounts window.",width=]

The Account Tree window (also known as a Chart of Accounts, or CoA) provides an overview of the data contained
in the current file. It contains a list of account names and their
current balances.

From this window, you can open the register of any
account either by double-clicking the account name, right clicking the account name and selecting Open Account from the
menu, or by using the Open button on the toolbar. GnuCash allows you to have as many account registers open as you wish. For more information on using account registers, see <<basics-register2>>.


[TIP]
====
Clicking the small triangle to the left of an account that has children will expand the tree view showing child accounts.

====

At the top of this window is the __Titlebar__, which displays the
file name for this set of accounts (once you have saved the file.) Below that is the __Menubar__.
You can access the menu options by either clicking on these menu
headings or by using shortcuts and access keys (see <<basics-shortcut2>>).
Next is the __Toolbar__, which contains buttons
for the most common functions.

The account tree appears below the __Toolbar__. Once you have
started creating accounts, the account names will appear in the account
tree. You can customize which headings show up by using the
small down-arrow at the far right just above the account tree.

At the bottom is the __Statusbar__, which tells you
information about what you own (Net Assets) and how much money you have
made (Profits).

[[basics-register2]]

==== Account Register Window

Account Register windows are used to enter and edit your
account data. As the name suggests, they look similar to a checkbook
register.

[[basics-CheckAccount]]
.The Checking Account Register
image::figures/basics_CheckAccount.png["This image shows the Checking Account - Register with several transactions.",width=]

<<chapter_txns>> explains more about account
register windows and how to
enter data into them. For now, note that the parts of an account
register window are similar to the parts of the account tree window
described earlier. The __Titlebar__ at the top contains the account name.
Below that, the __Menubar__ contains menu options related to the account
register. __Toolbar__ buttons simplify common data entry functions. The
__Statusbar__ at the bottom of the window, displays some account balances
covered in <<chapter_txns>>. At the bottom of the
account register window,
information appears about the current location of the cursor.


[NOTE]
====
In the register windows, you can resize the various columns that
GnuCash displays, __but keep in mind that the Description and Balance columns behave differently from other columns__.

The Description column is designed to expand
automatically to fill all unused horizontal screen space.
Therefore you should set the widths of all your other columns before
setting the Description column width.

The Balance column must be resized by
double-clicking on the column heading.

====

[[basics-toolbar2]]

==== Toolbar Buttons

Both the account tree window and the account register window
contain __Toolbar__ buttons. These buttons provide quick access to common
functions such as Save and
Open in the account tree window and
Record and Delete in the
account register window. If you are not sure what a button does, move
the mouse pointer over that button, and you should see a description of
the function appear.

Here is a summary of the account tree window buttons:

Save:: Save the current file to disk

Close:: Close the current notebook page

Open, Edit,
 New and Delete:: These are functions related to accounts. They are discussed in
<<chapter_accts>>.

Register-specific buttons are discussed in <<chapter_txns>>.


[[basics-tabbar]]

==== Tab Bar

GnuCash uses a tabbed model that allows you to open multiple account registers and reports simultaneously. Each open window (which can include account registers, reports, or Scheduled Transactions windows) is given a tab on this bar that you can click to view that window. Tabs can be configured in Preferences to appear along any side of the GnuCash window.

To see the full name for a tab, hover the mouse pointer over an account window tab.

If more screens are open than can be displayed across the screen, some tabs
will not display.  You can move through all tabs by clicking the arrows on
either end of the tab bar. A complete list of tabs can be viewed by
right-clicking the Tab Bar and any tab can be selected by clicking it.

[[basics-options2]]

==== Menu Items

The account tree window and the account register window both
contain menu headings in a __Menubar__. Clicking on a menu heading brings
up the menu items for that heading.

You can click on the account tree menu headings and then move the
mouse pointer over the menu items to see what they do. As the pointer
moves over a menu item, a description of the item appears in the lower
left-hand corner of the window (inside the __Statusbar__). To select a menu item, click on
it.

You can also access the most common menu items in a window by
right-clicking the mouse anywhere in that window. In the account tree
window, this will bring up a list of account items. In the account
register window, this will bring up a list of transaction items.

Other ways of accessing menu items are through keyboard shortcuts
and access keys, described next.

[[basics-shortcut2]]

==== Menu Shortcuts

All of the menu items have access keys which are
marked by underlined characters in the menu names. Pressing the
Alt key with the underlined character in the menu
heading will bring up the menu items for that heading. Once the menu
items are displayed, type the underlined character in the menu item to
activate it. For example, typing AltF in the main window brings up the 
menu, then typing S will save the file.  Access keys
are fixed and cannot be changed by users.

Some of the more commonly used menu items also have shortcut keys
that directly activate the command without having to traverse the menu
structure.  These shortcuts typically use the Ctrl
key, although they can use any key combination.  Menu shortcuts are
displayed at the end of each menu item.

[[basics-help1]]

=== Getting Help

GnuCash offers help in many ways. We have already covered the <<basics-tip2,
    Tip of the Day>> screen that gives you helpful hints
upon start-up of your GnuCash session. GnuCash also offers an extensive
help manual.

[[basics-manual2]]

==== Help Manual

Once you have opened GnuCash, you will see the Account
      Tree window Help menu heading, which
opens the Help manual. The Help manual is organized by topic, and
you can expand each topic into its subtopics.

Topics are listed on the left side. To select a topic or subtopic,
click on it, and you should see the text for that topic appear on the
right. Use the Back and
Forward buttons to navigate through your topic
choices, and print any text using the Print
button.

[[basics-web2]]

==== Web Access

The GnuCash Help window also acts as a simple
web browser, so you can pull up a web site for additional information.
You can open any web site under this window by clicking the
Open__Toolbar__ button and then typing in the URL.
Use the Back, Forward,
Reload, Stop, and
Print buttons as you would in a standard
browser.

The link:$$http://www.gnucash.org$$[GnuCash] web
site contains helpful information about the program and about any
updates to it. It also contains links to the GnuCash mailing lists for
developers and users, and you can search the link:$$https://lists.gnucash.org/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi$$[archives
      of GnuCash mailing lists] for discussions on a
particular topic. If you don&rsquo;t find the answers you are looking for, you
can post your question to the link:$$https://lists.gnucash.org/mailman/listinfo/gnucash-user$$[GnuCash
      user list], and someone on the list will attempt to
answer you.

The most updated GnuCash FAQ is also located
on the link:$$http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ$$[GnuCash
      FAQ website], and contains answers to the popular
questions.

[[basics-topic2]]

==== Topic Search

The online manual also provides a search function. To search for a
particular topic, click the Search tab at the
bottom of the help window and type in your topic in the field provided.
Click the Search button to complete your search.
A list of choices should appear in the box below, clicking a choice will
bring up its text on the right.

[[basics-files1]]

=== Storing your financial data

GnuCash is able to <<basics-store-data,store>>
your financial data in files or SQL databases so that they can be
<<basics-open-data,opened>> and modified at a later time.
But first you need to <<basics-create-data,create>> a container for your data.

[[basics-create-data]]

==== Creating a file

To create a new GnuCash file do the following:


. From the GnuCash__Menubar__, choose menu:File[New File]. The New Account Hierarchy setup
assistant will start.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running GnuCash for the first time, you will be presented
with the Welcome to GnuCash! screen. This screen is described in detail in the
GnuCash manual.

====


. Set your preferences in the assistant and move through the screens with the
Forward, Cancel and Previous
buttons.

[[basics-store-data]]

==== Saving data

Follow these steps to save the file under your preferred name:


. Choose menu:File[Save
        As...] from the __Menubar__ or select the
Save__Toolbar__ button. GnuCash will bring
up the save window.


. Select the Data Format of the file you are saving from the
drop down list. The default selection is XML but if you have set up a
database back end you can change to that format.
+
Depending on the selected Data Format the window can change as
described in the following.


. &#160;
+


** If you selected XML or sqlite3 you will see a screen like this:
+
[[basics-SaveXML]]
.The Save screen
image::figures/basics_SaveXML.png["This image shows the Save screen when the selected Data Format is XML or sqlite3.",width=]

+
Type your chosen filename in the Name field. It is not necessary to specify an
extension when you write the file name. GnuCash will automatically add the extension
__.gnucash__ to the file.
+
[NOTE]
====
The __.gnucash__ extension was introduced in the 2.3 series of GnuCash.
For already existing files, the extension will never be changed. So if you open an existing file named
__Myoldfile__, that name won&rsquo;t be changed if the file is saved. You might use the
Save As... &gt;  command and give the file a new name in order to have it saved with the
extension __.gnucash__.

====
+
Select the path where the file will be saved by browsing the tree in the lower panes.
+
[TIP]
====
Click on the Create Folder button to create a new folder with a
custom name in the selected path.

====

** If you selected mysql or postgresData Format you will see a screen like this:
+
[[basics-SaveSQL]]
.The Save screen
image::figures/basics_SaveSQL.png["This image shows the Save screen when the selected Data Format is mysql or postgres.",width=]

+
Enter in this window the Database Connection information:
Host, Database, Username
and Password.
+
[WARNING]
====
Saving to mysql or postgres requires the proper permissions in that
database, that is you need to have the permissions to create a new database with the given database name, or
you need to have write access to an existing database with the given database name.

====



. Click the Save As button to save the
file.

If you are keeping track of finances for a single household, you
need only one file. But if you are also tracking business finances or want
to keep data separate for some reason, then you will need more than one
file.

Before ending each GnuCash session, be sure to save your data
changes using menu:File[Save] or the Save__Toolbar__
button.

[NOTE]
====
As it is very important to save your data frequently to avoid losing them for whatever reason,
GnuCash is able to automatically save the opened file every a certain amount of time.
This interval can be set in the General tab under
menu:Edit[Preferences]
(menu:GnuCash[Preferences] on Mac OS X).
Keep in mind that this option is relevant only if you are saving in XML format.
If you are working with a database, the Save button and the Save
menu entry will be grayed out because changes are stored right away.

====



[[basics-open-data]]

==== Opening data

To open an existing file or database, select menu:File[Open] from the menu. In the window that will open,
select the Data Format. If you selected File choose the file you want to open
by browsing the folders in the lower panes. Else, enter the required Database Connection
information.


[TIP]
====
GnuCash keeps a list of the recently opened files. Open the File
menu and you will see listed the names of recently opened files. Click on the one you want to load to open it.

====

[[basics-expt-acct]]

==== Duplicating an Account Hierarchy

In some cases, it might be useful to duplicate the structure of an existing data file in a new file.
For example, you might want to try out new accounting techniques without corrupting your actual
accounting data, or you might need to follow accounting guidelines that require you to close your books at the end
of the year and begin each year with a fresh set of books.

GnuCash allows you to create an empty copy of your Chart of Accounts simply by selecting
menu:File[Export &gt; Export Accounts].
When you select this command, you are asked to provide the name for the new empty file, and GnuCash
creates a new data file that contains only your account hierarchy (that is, there is no transaction data).
Once saved, the new file can be opened like any other GnuCash data file as described above.

[[basics-backup1]]

=== Backing Up and Recovering Data

GnuCash creates several types of files to help ensure that your data
is not lost. If you look in the folder where your saved file resides, you may see other
files generated by GnuCash with the following extensions: __.gnucash__,
__.log__, __.LCK__, __.LNK__ in the same directory
as your primary data file. What each of these files does is presented below.


[NOTE]
====
The following sections are relevant only if you are saving your financial data in the XML format

====


----

      $ ls
      myfile.gnucash
      myfile.gnucash.20100414185747.gnucash
      myfile.gnucash.20100414223248.log
      myfile.gnucash.20100415114340.gnucash
      myfile.gnucash.20100415154508.log
      myfile.gnucash.20100415173322.gnucash
      myfile.gnucash.20100415194251.log
      myfile.gnucash.7f0982.12093.LNK
      myfile.gnucash.LCK
    
----

[[basics-backupxac2]]

==== Backup file (.gnucash)

Each time you save your data file, a backup copy will also be
saved with the extension __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__. This backup file is a complete copy of
your previous data file, and the filename format refers to the data
file, year, month, day and time of the backup. For example, the filename
__myfile.gnucash.20100414185747.gnucash__ indicates this is a
backup copy of the file __myfile__ saved in the year
2010, April 14, at 6:57:47 p.m.

To restore an old backup file, simply open the __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__ file with the
date to which you wish to return. Be sure to save this file under a
different name.


[NOTE]
====
__.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xac__ instead of the actual extension __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__.
So if you upgrade from the 2.2 series to the 2.4 series, you may end up with both __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xac__
and __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__ backup files in your directory.

====

[[basics-backuplog2]]

==== Log file (.log)

Each time you open and edit a file in GnuCash,
GnuCash creates a log file of changes you have made to your data file.
The log file uses a similar naming format as the backup files:
__.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log__. Log files
are not a full backup of your data file - they simply record changes you
have made to the data file in the current GnuCash session.

In case you exit GnuCash inadvertently, possibly due to a power
outage or a system wide crash, it is possible to recover most of your
work since the last time you saved your GnuCash file using this log
file. This is the procedure:


. Open the last saved GnuCash file.


. Go to menu:File[Import &gt; Replay GnuCash .log file]
and select the one .log file with the same date as the saved file
you just opened. Make sure that you picked the right .log file, or
you will possibly wreak havoc in your accounts.

Log replaying will recover any transaction affecting the balance
entered since the last save, including those created from scheduled
transactions and business features (invoices, bills, etc.).


[WARNING]
====
Changes to the scheduled transactions, invoices or
bills themselves are NOT recovered, and their transactions that were
recovered may not be properly associated with them, and should thus be
double-checked. Especially for business transactions, you may have to
delete and re-create some of them. If you do not, although the balance
will be correct, some reports may not.

====

[[basics-backuplock2]]

==== Lock files (.LNK and .LCK)

You may occasionally see __.LNK__ and __.LCK__ files appear. These do not
store any data, but they are created to prevent more than one user from
opening the same file at the same time. These files are automatically
created when you open the file, to lock it so no one else can access it.
When you close your GnuCash session or open another file, GnuCash
unlocks the first data file by deleting the __.LCK__ and __.LNK__ files.

If GnuCash crashes while you have a data file open, the __.LCK__ and
__.LNK__ files are not deleted. The next time you try to open GnuCash, you
will get a warning message that the file is locked. The warning message
appears because the __.LNK__ and __.LCK__ files are still in your directory. It is
safe to choose Yes to open the file, but you should delete the __.LNK__ and
__.LCK__ files (using a terminal window or your file manager). Once those
files are deleted, you will not get the warning message again unless
GnuCash crashes.

[[basics-backupmanage2]]

==== File Management

So which files should you keep around? Keep your main data file,
of course. It&rsquo;s a
good idea to keep some of the more recent __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__ backup files, but you can safely
delete the __.log__ files since they are not complete copies of your data.


[NOTE]
====
If you upgraded from a GnuCash version prior to 2.4, you may also have backup files
in the old __.xac__ format. For these files you can apply the same principle described above for
__.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__ backup files.

====

You should also delete any __.LCK__ and __.LNK__ files that you see after
closing GnuCash. If you decide to back up your data file to another
disk manually, it&rsquo;s enough to back up the main data file - not the __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__
backup files.


[NOTE]
====
By default GnuCash will automatically delete any __.log__ and __.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash__
backup files that are older than 30 days. You can change this behavior in the GnuCash
preferences in the General tab under menu:Edit[Preferences]
(menu:GnuCash[Preferences] on Mac OS X).

====

[[basics-migrate-settings]]

=== Migrating GnuCash data

Sometimes you may need to move your financial data and GnuCash settings to another machine.
Typical use cases are when you buy a new computer or if you want to use the same settings over two different operating
systems in a dual boot configuration.

[[migrate-financial]]

==== Migrating financial data

Migrating GnuCash financial data is a as simple as copying  __.gnucash__
files with a file manager if you know where they are saved. If you can&rsquo;t remember where a file is stored
but you can open it directly within GnuCash, save it in the desired path from within
GnuCash.

All other files in the folder are either backups or log files. It won&rsquo;t do any harm to copy them too, but it&rsquo;s not likely
to do any good, either.

[[migrate-prefs]]

==== Migrating preferences data

Preferences are stored in three different locations: one for GnuCash preferences,
one for reports, and one for online banking settings. Preferences are managed by
gsettings, reports are managed by GnuCash
itself, and online banking is managed by aqbanking. If you do not use online banking,
then you will not have this folder on your machine.

Where the GnuCash preferences are stored varies
depending on your operating system (see <<App-sett-loc>>, <<Report-loc>>, and
<<OB-sett-loc>>). To back up and transfer your entire installation, you must copy
these preferences as well.

[[App-sett-loc]]

=== Putting It All Together


[NOTE]
====
This section begins a tutorial that will continue throughout this
book. At the end of each chapter, you will see a Putting It
      All Together section that walks you through examples to
illustrate concepts discussed in that section. Each Putting It
      All Together section builds on the previous one, so be sure
to save your file for easy access.

====

Let&rsquo;s get started!


. First, let&rsquo;s create a file to store your real data. Open GnuCash
and select menu:File[New File]
from the __Menubar__. This will start the New Account Hierarchy Setup assistant that allows
you to create several accounts at once.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running GnuCash for the first time, you will be presented with the
Cannot find default values screen which is described in details in the
GnuCash manual.

Click the Forward button to proceed to the next screen.


. In the second screen, select the currency to use for the new accounts from the dropdown list.
Then press the Forward button.

[NOTE]
====
The currency you select here, will be assigned to all the
accounts created in this assistant.

      Balance on each of the accounts, as well as indicate if
the account should be a Placeholder. As these features will be
