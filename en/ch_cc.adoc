== Credit Cards

This chapter will show you how to manage your credit cards using
GnuCash.

[[cc-concepts1]]

=== Concepts

Since you probably write a check or make an electronic payment to
the credit card company each month, you may think of your credit card bill
as an expense - but it really is not an expense. Why? A credit card
account is a short-term loan - you buy things on that loan account, and
then you eventually have to pay back the money, often with interest (your
finance charge). The purchases you make with that credit card are your
expenses.

You have a couple of options when entering credit card transactions,
so choose the one that fits your desired level of detail. The simplest
method is to simply track monthly payments to the credit card company.
From your bank account, you enter a transfer of money each month to the
credit card expense account. This will show you the amount of money you
are paying each month to the credit card company, but it won&rsquo;t show you
any information about your credit card balance or credit card
purchases.

A more complete way to track your credit card in GnuCash is to enter
each purchase and payment as a separate transaction. Using the credit card
account register, you enter your receipts throughout the month. When your
credit card statement arrives, you reconcile the credit card account to
the statement, and you enter your payment as a transfer of money from your
checking account to your credit card account. This method gives you more
information about your balance during the month and points out any
discrepancies during reconciliation, but you will have to do more data
entry.

[[cc-accounts1]]

=== Setting Up Accounts

To begin managing your credit cards in GnuCash, you should set up a
Liability top level account and under this parent account create credit
card type accounts for each credit card you use. If you are tracking only
the payments you make to the credit card company, then all you need is a
bank account and a credit card account to enter your transactions.

The charges you make on your credit card are expenses, so you will
have to set up these accounts under the top-level account called
Expenses. If you decide to keep a more detailed records of your
purchases, you will need to create expense accounts for each kind of
purchase you make. Since you will also be reconciling the balance to your
credit card statements, you should also enter an opening balance in each
credit card account. The easiest way to do this is to use your last
statement balance as the opening balance.

[[cc-accounts-simple2]]

==== Simple Setup

If you do not want to track each expense made on the credit card,
you can set up a simple account hierarchy like this:


....

-Assets
   -Bank
-Liabilities
   -Credit Card
-Expenses
   -Credit Card
   
....
In this example, if you enter your total amount charged per month
as a transaction between __Liabilities:Credit Card__ and
__Expenses:Credit Card__. When you make a payment, you would
enter a transaction between __Assets:Bank__ and
__Liabilities:Credit Card__.

The obvious limitation of this simple credit card setup is that
you cannot see where your money is going. All your credit card expenses
are being entered in the Credit Card expense account. This is, however,
very simple to set up and maintain.

[[cc-accounts-complete2]]

==== Complete Setup

If you want to track your expenses more completely, you should
set up multiple expense accounts named for the various kinds of expenses
you have. Each charge on your credit card is then entered as a separate
transaction between your Credit Card liability account and a specific
expense account. Below is an example of an account hierarchy for
this:


....

-Assets
    -Bank
-Liabilities
    -Credit Card
-Expenses
    -Food
    -Car
    -Clothes
    -Entertainment
    -Interest
    -Service
   
....
Clearly, you should enter specific expense accounts which fit your
spending habits. The only difference with this setup as compared to the
simple setup is that the expenses have been subdivided by groups. Also
notice that there is an "Interest" expense, this is used for when your
credit card charges interest on your monthly unpaid balance. The
"Service" expense account is used to track service expenses associated
with the credit card, such as the yearly usage fee if it exists. With
this setup, you will be able to see where your money goes every month,
grouped according to the expense accounts.

The rest of this chapter will assume you are using the complete
setup.

[[cc-entercharge1]]

=== Entering Charges

Entering your charges provides you with a more complete picture of
your spending habits. Charges on a credit card are tracked as a
transaction between the credit card liability account and the appropriate
expense account.

When you pay for goods or services with your credit card, you are telling the credit card company to pay the merchant for you. This transaction will increase the amount of money you owe the credit card company, and the credit card balance will increase. The other side of these transactions will in most cases be an expense account. For example, if you buy clothing from a store with your credit card for $50, you would be transferring that money from the credit account into Expenses:Clothing.

Entering these transactions into GnuCash allows you to track how much you owe the credit card company, as well as provides you a better picture of your overall accounts. It also allows you to monitor your account and ensure that fraud is avoided.

Adding transactions to a credit card account is similar to entering transactions in other accounts. You can enter them manually, or import them from your credit card company using a compatible import format.

For assistance with entering transactions, see Chapter 6 of the Help manual and <<chapter_txns>>.

[[cc-enterpay1]]

=== Entering Payments

Most payments to your credit card bill are entered as transfers from
a bank account (asset) to the credit card account (liability). When you
pay the monthly bill, you are withdrawing money from a bank account to pay
down the credit card balance. This transaction decreases both your bank
account balance and the amount of credit card debt you owe.

When you return a purchase, you receive a refund on your credit
card. This is another type of payment in that it decreases the amount of
credit card debt you owe. If you recorded the original purchase
transaction as a transfer from the credit card account to the expense, you
now simply reverse that transaction: transfer the money back from the
expense to the credit card account. This transaction decreases both the
expense account balance and the credit card account balance. For example,
if you originally recorded a credit card purchase of clothing, the
transaction is a transfer from the credit card account to the clothing
expense account. If you then return that clothing for a refund, you simply
transfer the money back from the clothing expense account to the credit
card account.


[NOTE]
====
A common mistake is to enter a refund as income. It is not income,
but rather a "negative expense". That is why you must transfer money
from the expense account to your credit card when you receive a
refund.

====

To clarify this, let&rsquo;s run through an example. You bought some jeans
for $74.99 on your VISA card, but realized one day later that they are too
big and want to return them. The shop gracefully agrees, and refunds your
credit card.


. Start with opening the previous datafile we stored
(__$$gcashdata_5$$__), and store it as
__$$gcashdata_6$$__.


. Open the __Liabilities:Visa__ account register
and enter a simple 2 account transaction to pay the $74.99 jeans
purchase. The Transfer account should be
__Expenses:Clothes__ and you
Charge your __Visa__ account with the $74.99.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since we had not created the __Expenses:Clothes__ account
previously, GnuCash will prompt us to create it. Just remember to
create it as an Expense account

====


. Enter the refund in one of the following way.
+


** Enter the same transaction as the purchase transaction, but
instead of a "Charge" amount, use a "Payment" amount in the Credit
Card account register.

** Select the purchase transaction you want to refund (that is
the Jeans transaction in our case), and selecting
menu:Transaction[Add Reversing
            Transaction]. Modify the date as needed.

+
After reversing the transaction, your credit card account should
look something like this:
+
[[cc-Reversing-Transaction-1]]
.Refunded a credit card purchase
image::figures/cc_Reversing_Transaction_1.png["This image shows Liability:Credit Card - Register after reversing a purchase transaction.",width=]
+
And the __Expenses:Clothes__ register should
look something like this:
+
[[cc-Reversing-Transaction-2]]
.Refunded a credit card purchase
image::figures/cc_Reversing_Transaction_2.png["This image shows Expenses:Clothes register after reversing a purchase transaction.",width=]


. Save the GnuCash data file.

[[cc-together1]]

=== Putting It All Together

Now that we have covered the basic ideas behind the various
transactions you must make to successfully track your credit card in
GnuCash, let&rsquo;s go through an example. In this example, we will make credit
card purchases, refund two of the purchases, get charged interest on
the unpaid balance, reconcile the credit card account, and finally make a
partial payoff of the credit card.

[[cc-puttoget-openfile]]

==== Open GnuCash file

Start with opening the previous datafile we stored,
__$$gcashdata_5$$__, and store it as
__$$gcashdata_6$$__ directly. The main window should look
something like this: 

[[cc-accounts]]
.Starting account structure
image::figures/cc_accounts.png["Starting account structure for tracking a credit card in the putting it all together example.",width=]

[[cc-together-purchases2]]

==== Purchases

Let&rsquo;s make some purchases on our visa card. Start by buying $25
worth of food from the Greasy Spoon Cafe, $100 worth of clothing from
Faux Pas Fashions, $25 worth of gasoline from Premium Gasoline, $125
worth of groceries and household items from Groceries R Us (split
between $85 in groceries and $40 in household items) and finally, $60
worth of household items from CheapMart.

We also redo the exercise in previous chapter, with purchasing
a pair of Jeans for $74.99 on April 3, and refund them two days later.

The register window for the credit card liability should look like this:

[[cc-purchases]]
.Initial credit card purchases
image::figures/cc_purchases.png["Initial credit card purchases.",width=]

[[cc-together-refund2]]

==== Refund

Now suppose that on April 15th you return the clothes you bought
on April 11th from Faux Pas Fashions and they give you credit back on
your credit card. Enter a transaction for the credit card refund for the
full $100 amount. Remember to use the same transfer account you used for
the original purchase, and enter the amount under the Payment column.
GnuCash will automatically complete the name and transfer account for
you, but it will also automatically enter the $100 in the Charge column.
You will need to reenter the amount in the Payment column. The
transaction looks like this:

[[cc-refund]]
.Item return transaction
image::figures/cc_refund.png["Returning clothes to Faux Pas Fashions, refund to credit card.",width=]

[[cc-together-interest2]]

==== Interest Charge

After the month of spending, unfortunately, the credit card bill
arrives in the mail or you access it on-line through the internet. You
have been charged $20 in interest on the last day of April because of
the balance you carried from the previous month. This gets entered into
the credit card account as an expense.

[[cc-interest]]
.Interest charge
image::figures/cc_interest.png["Interest charge.",width=]

[[cc-together-reconcile2]]

==== Reconciliation

When your credit card bill arrives you should reconcile your
credit card account to this document. This is done using GnuCash&rsquo;s
built-in reconciliation application. Highlight the credit card account
and click on menu:Actions[Reconcile...]. This reconciliation procedure is
described in detail in the <<txns-reconcile1>>,
but we will step
through the process here as well. For this example, let&rsquo;s assume that
the credit card statement is dated May 1st, with a final balance of
$455. Enter these values in to the initial Reconcile window as shown
here.

[[cc-reconcile-init]]
.Initial reconcile window
image::figures/cc_reconcile_init.png["Initial account reconciliation window.",width=]

During the reconciliation process, you check off each transaction
in the account as you confirm that the transaction appears in both your
GnuCash account and the credit card statement. For this example, as
shown in the figure below, there is a $300 difference between your
GnuCash accounts and the credit card statement.

[[cc-reconcile]]
.Main reconcile window
image::figures/cc_reconcile.png["Main account reconciliation window, demonstrating a discrepancy of $300.",width=]

Some investigation uncovers that you forgot to record a payment
you made on March 5th to the credit card company for $300, you
must enter this payment transaction from your bank account to the credit
card. Now the credit card statement and your GnuCash account can be
reconciled, with a balance of $455.

[[cc-together-payment2]]

==== Payment

Assuming you have completed reconciliation of your credit card
account, you need to make a payment to the credit card company. In this
example, we owe $455 but will make a partial payment of $300 again this
month. To do so, enter a transaction from your bank account to the
credit card account for $300, which should reduce your credit card
balance to $155. Your credit card account register should now appear
like this:

[[cc-payment]]
.Reconciliation and payment
image::figures/cc_payment.png["Account register after account reconciliation and payment.",width=]

Go back to the main window and save your file
(__$$gcashdata_6$$__). Your chart of accounts is steadily
growing, and it should now look like this:

[[cc-final]]
.GnuCash main window
image::figures/cc_final.png["GnuCash Chart of Accounts after account reconciliation and payment.",width=]

[[cc-puttoget-save]]

==== Save file

Last, save the GnuCash data file (__$$gcashdata_6$$__).

[[cc-puttoget-reports]]

==== Reports

As we did in the previous chapters, let&rsquo;s have a look at a
Cash Flow, and a Transaction Report.



. First let&rsquo;s have a look at the Cash Flow report
for the liability account Visa during the month of March.
+
Select the cash flow report from menu:Reports[Income &amp; Expense &gt; Cash Flow].

+
[[cc-puttoget2-Cash]]
.Cash Flow report for the month of March
image::figures/cc_CashFlow.png["This image shows the Cash Flow report after .",width=]


. Now let&rsquo;s have a look at corresponding transaction report for the Visa
account.

+
Select the transaction report from menu:Reports[Transaction Report].

+
[[cc-puttoget2-TransactionRptVisa]]
.Transaction Report for the Visa account during March/April
image::figures/cc_TransactionRptVisa.png["This image shows the Transaction Report for the Visa account during March/April.",width=]


. Now let&rsquo;s change the transaction report to only show the various
Expenses accounts.
